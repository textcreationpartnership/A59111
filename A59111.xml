            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAVING ſadly obſerved, how much Injury the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by multiplied Diſputes; and that the beſt Methods which the wiſeſt men have uſed to ſtifle ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Controverſies, have unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly begot more of the kind; I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try, whether diverting the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor might not tend to the cure of the Malady; and the imploying of our time in Devotional Offices, might not dull the Edg of a quarrelſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; the Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never promoted ſo readily as by conſtant Prayers, frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a holy Life. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration gave being to theſe Papers,
<pb facs="tcp:63922:4"/>which for the moſt part were penned when I was at a great diſtance from Books; but happy in leaſure, which gave me many opportunities of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on my Duty, and of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to fit my own Soul, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the worthy receiving of the Holy Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>And tho it may ſeem a bold attempt to preſume to write a Treatiſe on this Subject, after ſo many excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes publiſht by others to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; yet, if the Book anſwer the deſign of the Author, and become uſeful to inflame the deſires of Men, and make them in Love with the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, and the other Offices of Holy Religion, that Objection will vaniſh of courſe; for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath attained his end, if the Name of God be glorified, the Laws of Chriſtianity obeyed, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Chriſtianity reverenc'd. And perhaps Books of Devotion ſhould be multiplied, that every Perſon of
<pb facs="tcp:63922:4"/>whatever Temper, Genius or Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he may be, may, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be invited to the Love and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our bleſſed Saviours Precepts, that if one Book do not pleaſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may; and that Treatiſe is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily penn'd, that Reſcues, tho but one Soul from the Dominion of Satan, and the Snares of Vice.</p>
            <p>I am conſcious to my ſelf, that I have preſcribed ſuch Rules, which God knows I have not ſo carefully obſerv'd, as I ought; and have expreſt my ſelf in Language, to which my Performances bear no Proportion; but withal, I am aſſured, that both my ſelf, and every one of Gods Prieſts, and in truth every Chriſtian, ought to live according to theſe Injuctions, and ought to mourn over our imperfect Obedience, and our neglect of our Duties; nor is a good Book the leſs uſeful, becauſe its Author is not an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Example of every Virtue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in it. It hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
<pb facs="tcp:63922:5"/>and is to this day a juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, That we are all ſo eager after the Tree of Knowledg, that we loſe the Tree of Life; that by purſuing the aims of an unbecoming Ambition, like <hi>Adam,</hi> we firſt forfeit the true Image of God, and then expoſe our own Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being rob'd of the Ornaments of Truth and Virtue, while we are in Love with the imaginary Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fantaſtick Learning; upon which account it too often happens, that few men have leſs Senſe of, and regard for Piety, than many who have ſpent their days in Books and Studies; but this is ſo far from being a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the well-inclined Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites of Holineſs, that it ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incite their Affection toward Heaven, ſince our bleſſed Maſter hath aſſured us, that Immortality and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory are not gotten by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Myſteries, but by an humble conformity to his Laws and Example; and that the illiterate,
<pb facs="tcp:63922:5"/>but pious part of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons, ſhall take Heaven by a holy Violence, when the notions of the unconverted Scholar ſhall but increaſe his Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, That <hi>Greece</hi> was never more debaucht, than when the Seven wiſe Men lived in it; and perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Age of the World more Learned, nor ever more Wicked than this; a great part of which Lewdneſs is owing to the neglect of the Bleſſed Sacrament. For did men but ſeriouſly conſider, that our Holy Redeemer hath enjoyned the frequent uſe of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, they durſt not be ſo bold as to trample on the Injunction; did they remember, that the Apoſtles pray'd,
<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:63922:6"/>diſuſe of this daily Sacrifice brought in private Maſſes into the Church, with many other Inconveniences; Did they but ſolemnly reflect on the great and wonderful Bleſſings that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in this Sacrament, it would be impoſſible that the Houſe and Table of God could be ſo ſlighted, as we ſee they are; and there would be no need of Canons and ſecular Laws to injoin us to make our ſelves happy; but men will not be perſwaded, that the Severities of Chriſtianity are Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make their Lives comfortable, and their Deaths ſafe; they indulge to preſent Enjoyments, and forget the Impartial Account of the laſt Day; when, if the Righteous ſhall hardly be ſaved, where ſhall the Sinners and the Ungodly appear? If the Holy

               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was ſo affected with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Holy Writ gives of that Judgment, that he tells the World, he trembled as often as he
<pb facs="tcp:63922:6"/>heard thoſe Words (<hi>God ſhall render to every man according to his Works)</hi> affirming, that every other wiſe man ſhares in the ſame Fear, and is under the ſame Agonies; if ſo few ſhall be ſaved (as the ſame Father paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goes on) that not a hundred of ſo many <hi>Myriads</hi> as live at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where that Eloquent Prelate Preach'd, ſhould eſcape the dreadful Sentence of Eternal Condemnation; what will become of us, and with what confidence can we go on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking, in thoſe Paths that lead to the Chambers of Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
            <p>I have pitcht upon the Holy Week, as the ſeaſon of Devotion; not that the Offices will not ſerve for any other time of the year; but, becauſe <hi>Eaſter</hi> was the time when all men, even the moſt indevout and ungovernable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, thought themſelves bound to receive the Euchariſt; as alſo, becauſe it is one of the times when our
<pb facs="tcp:63922:7"/>Church enjoins all her Children upon the peril of her Cenſures, to come to the Table of God; for which end it preſcribes Faſting, and requires their Attendance at the Church every day of this Week, to prepare themſelves for the receipt of the Solemn Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which that Feſtival brings. And in truth, the whole <hi>Lent</hi> is but, as it were, an <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Eaſter;</hi> but more eſpecially, the laſt Week of <hi>Lent,</hi> which Repreſents in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons, The <hi>Triumphant entry of Chriſt into</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>The Conſpiracy of</hi> Judas <hi>and the</hi> Jews <hi>to betray him; The Inſtitution of the Bleſſed Sacrament; The Crucifixion, And the Deſcent into Hell.</hi> On this Week, the Church ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from all Senſualities and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pleaſures, lived upon a dry Diet; their Sorrow was deep, their Prayers intenſe, their Faſtings ſtrict, and their Watchings frequent; and for this Reaſon I have after the pattern of

               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his Homilies, prefac'd every days Devotion with an account of the time, and the Primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices on that day; that the Ignorant and Unlearned might know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why ſuch days are ſet apart by the Church of God; as being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that the <hi>Lents</hi> and <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, are one of the moſt ſuccesful means, next the Bleſſing of God, of maintaining the Chriſtian Religion among them, in deſpite of all the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Artifices, and cruelty to ruin it.</p>
            <p>I have alſo (beſides an account of the Ancient Uſages relating to the Holy Sacrament) ſubjoyned an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Goſpel, Meditation, Prayer, and Anthem, ſuited to the time (tho not ſo fitted to every particular day of the Great Week, but that they may be more or leſs made uſe of according to the Capacities and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion of the Devout Chriſtian, on any day of that Week, or on any
<pb facs="tcp:63922:8"/>other Week of the Year) and for <hi>Friday,</hi> I have annex'd a method of Self-Examination, together with a <hi>Litany,</hi> and other Collects (which alſo may be uſed on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> or on any other, or every day of the Week) becauſe that day is a faſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day through the whole Church of God, and the time when our Holy Redeemer was Crucified, upon whoſe Death depends all the Honour and Happineſs of the Chriſtian World. Nor have I inſerted a <hi>Litany</hi> of my own, as if I were ſo vain to prefer it to that incomparable <hi>Litany</hi> which our Church enjoyns; but, becauſe there ſeems to be a need of a more particular Deprecation of Sins in the Cloſet, than in the publick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>And here I ſolemnly proteſt, That none of theſe private Offices can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone for the neglect of the Publick Service (which the Church enjoyns every day of this Week) but that
<pb facs="tcp:63922:8"/>every good man ought to frequent the Houſe of God, and to be preſent at all the Hours of Prayer; which if he neglects, I cannot ſee how he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Divine Bleſſing on his private Devotion. In the Circumſtantials of which private Worſhip, I have inſtanc'd in thoſe particulars which many good Chriſtians, to whom this Book may be ſerviceable, cannot enjoy; but every mans prudence muſt be his guide in ſuch Caſes; and he who hath not a Cloſet ſo furniſh'd, as is adviſed, ought to take care that he do not altogether want a place to pray in; and God will accept of him, not according to what he hath not, but according to what he hath.</p>
            <p>Here alſo I cannot but remark, and cenſure a moſt unbecoming practiſe of our Diſſenting Brethren, who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of our Saviour's command, <hi>that we ſhould pray in ſecret,</hi> chuſe their Cloſets commonly next the Street; and when they are in it, Pray aloud, tho
<pb facs="tcp:63922:9"/>alone, that all who paſs by, at leaſt that are in the houſe, may hear them; which what it can mean, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be heard of men, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; for if they heartily confeſs their ſins, and as I think, it ought to be in private Prayers, by name, and with all the Aggravating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have attended their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; What Temptations are ſuch People under, either to hide their ſins from God, that the World may not know them; or elſe ſo to acknowledg them, as not to be aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them, becauſe thoſe whoſe Vices are notoriouſly known, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take ſhelter in impudence.</p>
            <p>But how unhappily ſuch men do diſſerve the intereſts of Religion, is not the Subject of this Preface; only I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear remembring ſome few things that relate to this Sacrament: ſuch as their total neglect of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt in ſo palpable a manner, that one of their moſt Eminent Preachers
<pb facs="tcp:63922:9"/>confeſſes that he never gave it in 18 Years; their admitting none to the Participation of the Myſteries, but thoſe who were in Church-covenant with themſelves, as if there were any other Church-covenant beſides that of Baptiſm; or any other Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, but that of the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, which is the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints; their undecent, and rude diſtribution of it, not by the hands of the Prieſt, but from one to another, as if they were at a merry meeting, rather than at Gods Table; their ſlovenly Receiving of it ſitting, to the ſcandal of their Brethren, and to the Encouragement of the <hi>Socinian,</hi> and other Hereticks; with many other ſuch Uſages, which I ſhall not mention.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to account for in this Preface, but that I have freely made uſe of ſeveral paſſages (Prayers eſpecially) of the Ancients, and of ſome few Modern Writers, without
<pb facs="tcp:63922:10"/>any ſcruple (and I here profeſs ſo much by way of acknowledgment to all thoſe good men, by whom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited) for if God have the Glory, and the World the Benefit, it matters not who is the Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now may the God of Peace and Truth, enlighten the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of all Mankind, that they may know and love, and practice their Duty, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is called by the Name of Chriſt, may depart from Iniquity, and may delight to Communicate with his Saviour; that we all in Gods time may paſs from the Feſtivals of the Church on Earth, to the Everlaſting Feaſt that is held in Heaven.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is fit that every man who intends to live well, ſhould ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Rules how to ſpend every portion of his time as uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as much to Gods, and his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as he can: And becauſe the Reputation of Religion is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and its Intereſts fenc'd by Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63922:14"/>and Circumſtances; and holy Offices require a fit place, and ſelect opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherein they may be performed, it will be neceſſary, firſt, to ſpeak of thoſe Circumſtantials which are ſo conducive to the advantageous diſcharge of this duty. And Firſt, That it is requiſite that the conſiderate Chriſtian ſhould have a place of Retirement, is, I ſuppoſe, diſputed by none but the raſh, the vicious, and ungovernable. If therefore a mans worldly concerns will afford it him, the devoutly inclined ſhould allow himſelf a Cloſet; which Room, tho not by a ſolemn conſecration, yet by deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe, ſhould be deputed to the private diſcharge of the duties of Piety. Now a Cloſet is an Oratory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenſoever I go thither, I ought to be free from worldly conſiderations, and wholly intent upon the buſineſs of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for who ever turned a Chappel into a Counting-houſe, or a Shop? And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo brings a new advantage with it: For whenever I go there again, the view of the place brings to my mind the good thoughts, devotions and reſolves, that when I was laſt there, took up my time; and conſequently with eaſe, puts me afreſh
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63922:14"/>upon the ſame performances: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenever I go, tho but occaſionally, into my Cloſet, I am bound to ſay a ſhort Collect before I leave it; as he who by chance only goes through a Church, looks on himſelf obliged to make an halt, and to ſay his prayers. For let the apartment ſeem what it will to others, it is to me the houſe of God: it is no place for ſport or ſociety; for looſe thoughts, or vain words: it is a place of retirement, and not of company: and therefore ſhould be moſt remote from noiſe, and the diſturbances of the houſe; and becauſe it is the place I firſt go to after I am out of my bed, and the laſt that I take my leave of before I go to ſleep; this courſe not only ſecures Gods bleſſing on my undertakings, ſince I begin nothing without begging his help, nor end any thing without giving him thanks; but withal it makes me careful and devout, ſince I muſt do nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I dare not deſire Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the Cloſet ſhould be properly, if conveniently, toward the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and that way the Window ſhould look, not only becauſe it is the pleaſanteſt ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and introduces the early light, one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63922:15"/>of the beſt of Gods temporal Largeſſes; but becauſe in that part of Heaven proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly my Mediator and Advocate ſits at the Right Hand of his Father (for in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature he muſt be confin'd to ſome certain place) and toward that part the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians (and to them I muſt always pay a deep veneration) uſed to direct their prayers. This place ſhould be furniſht either for Neceſſity or Ornament. Some things are neceſſary for the diſcharge of the duties of reading, praying, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, which every good mans pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will dictate to him. And here for my ſelf I profeſs, That I think my ſelf always bound to pray on my knees, or in the more humble poſture of proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to read ſtanding, if my health will give leave, becauſe then I hear the Commands of my deareſt Maſter and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but I would meditate ſitting, if walking be not more acceptable to me, becauſe the man who would meditate to advantage, ſhould be no way diſcompoſed by any thing of uneaſineſs that may diſturb the mind or body.</p>
                     <p>The ornamental furniture ſhould be plain, but ſo ordered, that it may appear like an Oratory, and be a repreſentation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63922:15"/>in little, of the houſe of God. For that ſome Ornament is neceſſary, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, becauſe our bleſſed Saviour in the time of his loweſt humiliation, would not celebrate the Paſſeover, but

                     <p>On the days of my humiliation, I would have no other Pictures in the Cloſet (while at other times any draught that repreſents a grave and honeſt Subject, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough become the place), except a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> in his penitent poſture after the denial of his Maſter, or a lively Repreſentation of my dying Saviour, with this <hi>Motto, I deſire to know nothing but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and him crucified:</hi> For I would willingly have my bleeding Maſter always preſent to my eye, when I am well incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to encourage me; when bent to do evil, to reclaim me.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63922:16"/>But his Paſſion is an indiſpenſible Obligation to Piety: For what can endear holineſs ſo perſuaſively, as the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that Chriſt died <hi>to purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works?</hi> Can I look upon that ſad ſpectacle, and not be toucht with remorſe and compaſſion, and with a due conſideration, that my ſins brought my Saviour to ſo much ſhame and torture; and nothing but my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can anſwer the ends of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Lute,</hi> or ſome ſuch grave inſtrument (if the devout perſon hath any skill in Muſick), were very proper to joyn with the Voice in the praiſes of God.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63922:20"/>of Men and Angels, and ſealed by the moſt precious Body and Blood of the Son of God; who call themſelves Saints, and yet live more irregularly than Brutes: This very conſideration is enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a man to applaud the Morals of the Heathen World, and to believe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that body of holy Precepts is not the Goſpel of the bleſſed Jeſus, or ſuch men are not profeſſors of it: ſo ſtrongly are the generality of Mankind in a looſe and ungovernable Age, bent towards Vice and Ruin: Nor can it otherwiſe be expected, when men put on the form of godlineſs, in defiance to the power of it; and think, that the Redemption wrought out for them by Chriſt, is only a <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to do all ſort of abominations.</hi> Nor can I give a better Reaſon, why the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World are ſo degenerate from truth and holineſs, than that ſo few of us reflect on the Obligations of the Covenant that we have enter'd into with God, tho ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſo ſolemnly acknowledged by us, that we confidently lay claim to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but never mind the Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. May our gracious God ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forgive me, and the reſt of ſinners, our former neglect, as we may reſolve for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63922:20"/>the time to come, to alter our courſe, and put on more becoming Reſolutions, and faithfully make good what we have ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promis'd our Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>For when I ſeriouſly, and as becomes a Chriſtian, conſider with my ſelf the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which every baptized perſon hath to the Son of God; and that that initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrament was deſign'd, as to free him from his ſhare in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, ſo to engage to a life of Obedience to the Laws of our bleſſed Saviour; and that therefore <hi>we are buried with him in baptiſm, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life, reckoning our ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> I cannot but remember, that among all thoſe holy and beneficial Precepts which he hath bleſt the World with, that is none of the leaſt in advantage and uſefulneſs, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins me to do as he did in remembrance of his Paſſion, the great cauſe of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and happineſs, and encourages me to frequent communicating, becauſe <hi>as often as I do eat that bread, and drink that cup, ſo often do I ſhow forth the Lords death till he come;</hi> ſo often do I call to mind my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63922:21"/>old promiſes of obedience and conformity to the divine preſcription, and enter into new engagements to love and adore my Saviour.</p>
                     <p>How eagerly therefore ought my ſoul to purſue after, and to embrace all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of coming to that holy Table where God exhibits himſelf? Happy are thoſe Servants of his, who ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before him, and keep themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in that frame of mind that fits and encourages them to communicate every day. Happy are thoſe men who only want Occaſions, but are never defective in intention or preparation; who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without the Wedding Garment, nor without Oyl in their Lamps. How did our dear Saviour long to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Sacrament
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15.</note>; <hi>with deſire did he deſire to eat the paſſeover,</hi> at the cloſe of which the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was celebrated, <hi>before he ſuffered?</hi> And ſhouldſt not thou, my ſoul, as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly long to receive it? Were this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament like that of Baptiſm, not to be re-iterated, or but once only in my life to be received, and that juſt before my death, with what ardors of mind ſhould <hi>I wiſh to be diſſolv'd, that I might thus alſo be with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63922:21"/>my Saviour?</hi> And muſt the Bleſſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is common, be for that Reaſon cheap? Is the bread of Heaven become contemptible, becauſe it may be my daily food?</p>
                     <p>But remember, O my ſoul, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to approach this Venerable Altar, unleſs thy Repentance be ſincere, thy Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hearty, thy Reſolutions unalterable, thy Piety flaming, and thine Alms gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. My preparations ſhould be the ſame with thoſe of dying perſons, not of thoſe who have lived looſly all their days, in hopes to make their faint deſires of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when the pleaſures of the Earth have deſerted them, to paſs for true love to thoſe joys; but of thoſe who all their lives long have been crucified to the world. My care ought to be ſo to approach Gods Table on Earth, as if I were the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be carried by Angels to eat bread with him in his Kingdom. It is true, I am too ſenſible that this is more eaſily talkt of than done; that when the good Man is acting the Prieſt, and ſacrificing himſelf to God, then Satan is at his right hand, perplexing him. And I have ſadly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented, how difficult it is to deny my ſelf, to put off the Old Man, and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63922:22"/>my tranſgreſſions: But is it not, O my ſoul, much more ſad and difficult, more uneaſie and diſtracting, to be confin'd to utter darkneſs, and to endure the tortures of Hell in a remedileſs Eternity? To ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from a preſent ſtate of eaſe, is a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcourſe that is not to be allowed. Were I never ſo paſſionately bent to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie an unreaſonable Luſt, I doubt not but I ſhould be afraid to proceed, did any man but threaten me with immediate death, if I ſhould purſue my unlawful deſign: And ought I not with greater Reaſon to forbear, when that God who can neither lie nor deceive, threatens me with everlaſting damnation? Am I afraid of the crackling of Thorns, and will not Thunder ſcare me? Do I run away from an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and wilfully throw my ſelf into inſufferable flames? In the Name of God therefore I do now reſolve to fit my ſelf for the approaching Feſtival of <hi>Eaſter:</hi> and whatever I have heretofore done, I will no longer put off my dear Saviour, but will from this inſtant give my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his ſervice.</p>

And firſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Excuſes are very vain and unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: For the command to receive this Sacrament, is ſo plain and obligatory, that I am convinc'd nothing ſhould excuſe me from frequent communicating; And yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63922:23"/>ſo perverſe is my will, ſo ungovernable are my paſſions, that the good which I would do, Heave undone, and the evil which I ſhould not do, that I do; ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when I have a deſire to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, I preſently find that Ardor eaſily cool, and end in an unbecoming luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, and unconcernedneſs for the Offices of Religion. Thus I grow old before I am good: And to learn an act of Vertue is a buſineſs of time: while on the contrary, my ſins grow to maturity in their Cradle, and are like a ſpot of Oyl, which being at firſt hardly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, ſuddenly ſpreads its ſelf, till it fully the whole Garment. Satan, the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of Mankind, muſters many little Arguments to affright me, and my own heart is ſtrongly inclinable to comply with him; as if when God had made ſo noble a proviſion, and ſent out his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, his Miniſters, to call them who are bidden to the Wedding, he would contentedly be put off with ſlight anſwers, and poor excuſes. Oh, how apt is my Vicious Nature, either wholly to neglect the Offices of Religion, or to look on them as burthenſome and tedious, that the Prayers are too long, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63922:23"/>of the Sermon too ſharp! But if to the Prayers and Sermon the Euchariſt be added, I am too prone not only to be weary, but angry with God; and think it is well done to be ſo, not conſidering what an happineſs it is to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with my Saviour, and how much more uneaſie my ſtate would be, ſhould my God require from me, as he did from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch expenſive ſacrifices, and perſonal attendances on the ſolemn Feaſts at his Temple: as alſo how unreaſonable it is to imagine, that God hath adorn'd this inferior world with ſuch Variety of good things, only to ſwell my Pride, and pamper my Luſts; and in the mean time hath reſerved nothing for himſelf, but what is cheap, contemptible, and of no value?</p>
                     <p>One ſolemn excuſe is, I have no leiſure: and 'tis the plea of the men in the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18; &amp;c.</note> Parable. This, ſays a good man, ſounds like confeſſion and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but is in truth denial and defiance: it is called want of leiſure, but is in reality ſloth, idleneſs, and irreligion. Can I judg it equitable, to give all my time to my ſecular Buſineſs and Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63922:24"/>and none to my God, to whom I owe a liberal portion of my enjoyments; nay, all my enjoyments, and my ſelf too? Have I ſo many days to trifle away, and none for the concerns of Eternity? My whole life ſhould be one continued <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and every act of my Calling, either as a Man, or a Chriſtian, a preparative to the Communion, and to my Death. And would a man ſpend his hours ſo vainly, that when he hath moſt need of comfort, he ſhould moſt want it; and when he comes to die, be bereaved of all conſolation? And is not the ſame care to be taken, to fit my ſelf for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as for my laſt Account? What God now invites me to, is a matter of great weight; the buſineſs is, whether I intend to be ſaved, or not? If I think Heaven not worth the looking after, it is no wonder if I am <hi>to every good work a Reprobate,</hi> and inſenſible of my need of the means of Grace: But if I reſolve to be a Candidate for Glory (as it were better for me that I had never been born, than to live voluptuouſly here a while, and be damned for ever), I muſt apply my ſelf to that method that will give me a title to it; and the only method
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63922:24"/>is an holy life; and that ſtate is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable without means, among which, frequent communicating is an excellent inſtrument of conveying Grace into the mind, of renewing my Reſolutions, and applying to my ſoul the Merits of my Saviour: So that if I put any eſtimate on my ſalvation, there is a neceſſity of my coming often to God's Table; and when I ſay, I want time to prepare my ſelf, I mean, I want leiſure to be a Chriſtian; and I am not willing to take pains to be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another plauſible pretence for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting my ſelf, is, I am unworthy; and he <hi>who eats and drinks

God hath been wanting in nothing that is required on his part; my unworthineſs therefore is both my ſin, and alſo my puniſhment. Beſides, humility is a neceſſary preparation to this Sacrament, and an abſolute Renunciation of our ſelves, and our own Righteouſneſs, that we may depend ſolely on Chriſt, is one of the indiſpenſible qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to fit us for the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Feaſt: For

Nor is it inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that tho my Graces be weak when I approach this Altar, there God gives me his holy Spirit, if my ſins hinder it not, to enable me with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power and vigor to do his will. And as it is very dangerous to communicate unworthily, ſo to refuſe to come, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually dangerous: For <hi>not

                              <hi>Hom.</hi> 24. <hi>in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> to communicate in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, is as dangerous as the Peſtilence, or death it ſelf,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtome; to deſpiſe it is Sacriledg, and a ſcorn of the Bread and Waters of Life, and a depriving my ſelf
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63922:25"/>of the means to make me a true and perfect Chriſtian:</hi> For it is an excellent Maxim in Religion, He who is not fit to receive to day, will be leſs fit to morrow; and he who is not fit to communicate every day, will be fit to communicate no day, and in a ſmall time will throw off all fear of God. For if the end of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be to renew our Covenant made with our Saviour, of taking him for our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (which is the true Notion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) then the withdrawing our ſelves from this Sacrament can be accounted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Virtual ſlighting of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and renouncing our Obedience to our Saviour. For do I not put an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon God, when I ſay, <hi>the Table of the Lord is contemptible?</hi> For not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating (ſays a devout perſon) is the next ſin to apoſtatizing: for it is an actual diſowning our communion with our Head and his Members, and a cutting off of our ſelves from the body of Chriſt. And if unworthineſs may hinder me from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Euchariſt; am I not as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to pray, or to hear, as to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? And does not this plea tend to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percede all duty? May I not hear to my prejudice, and pray to my ruin? May
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63922:26"/>not the word that I have heard, riſe in Judgment againſt me, and my prayer be turned into ſin? And is it not as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly required of me, to do as my
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24.</note> Redeemer did, in remembrance of his Paſſion, as it is to frequent any other of his Ordinances? But what if God ſhould make that my fate which is now my choice, and deprive me by his Judgments of the liberty of enjoying thoſe Ordinances which I now contemn? Wouldſt not thou, O my ſoul, look on it as an aſtoniſhing Judgment, and ſuch a Decree, as thou wouldeſt give part of thy blood to reverſe? And muſt I be my own Executioner? And have I not enemies enough in the World, and Hell, that I muſt be my own moſt imbitter'd Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another hinderance is, that the preparation required is very difficult, and that it is no eaſie thing to be a Chriſtian. But this alſo is an unreaſonable ſuggeſtion: For tho the ſeverities of Mortification and Self-denial, appear in a formidable dreſs; yet in themſelves they are true ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For nothing can equal the Joy of that ſoul that is reſcued from eternal hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63922:26"/>And I ſhould rejoice to be pull'd out of a Dungeon, where elſe I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably periſh, tho it were by the hair; and to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> tho ſo <hi>as by fire.</hi> Men are poſſeſt before-hand with needleſs fears, and take characters of the ways of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs from the ſenſual and debauch'd; as if we ſhould put a deaf man to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of harmony. But to thoſe who have enter'd ſeriouſly upon the profeſſion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and made themſelves proſelites to Wiſdom, <hi>her ways</hi> appear to be <hi>ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſinner draws himſelf a Scheme of Vertue that is not correſpondent to the dictates of Reaſon, or Holy Scriptures: For Vertue is a Borderer upon our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Habits; and our evil inclinations may be made ſubſervient to piety; either, 1. by correcting the Exceſſes of Nature, and altering the degree of our Paſſions; So Grace turns Choler into a well-regulated Zeal, Melancholly into inclinations to Devotion, Abſtinence and Mortification: it makes the Flegmatick cautious and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to offend his God, and ready to be a penitent whenever he hath offended: and it makes the Sanguine apt to rejoice in God, and in the light of his countenance;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63922:27"/>to be eaſie to forgive, and willing to be reconciled; it warms the cold and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs into a religious and devout temper; it abates the eagerneſs of Covetouſneſs, till it become frugality; and eaſily changes the prodigal into a man of a liberal and generous mind. 2. Our evil Paſſions are without difficulty devoted to God, by altering the Object of our purſuits. For would the Voluptuous perſon purſue after Eternity, as he hath done after the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of his ſenſual Appetites; would the Miſer transfer his love from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> to the living and true God; and were the revengeful thoughts of the angry man no longer fixt upon his offending brother, but employed againſt his own Vices, how ſmooth would the path of Vertue appear, and how free from Thorns and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another Excuſe is, I am deterr'd from approaching to this Feaſt of fat things, becauſe I am not in Charity. But what ſhould hinder, why I ſhould not love all Mankind? Did not my bleſſed Saviour pray for his enemies at his Death? And is not the Sacrament a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that his Death? Now as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63922:27"/>call that man a Mariner that never learnt his Compaſs, nor that man a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that never fought; how much leſs can I call my ſelf a Chriſtian, who never conform to my Maſter's pattern? What man, but one of an impudent forehead, and moſt obdurate heart, can dare to pray his heavenly Lord to forgive him ten thouſand Talents, who will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his fellow-ſervant an hundred pence? And perhaps at laſt, I think many actions uncharitable which are not ſo

For I do not believe, that if my Neighbour cauſeleſly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with me the day before I am to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or I am without deſign engaged in the heat of talk, which is not ſinful, or a man forces me to go to Law with him, to recover my juſt right; that theſe things ſhall deprive me of the benefits of the Sacrament: For theſe things are my Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and I ſuffer them patiently, and ſtill am in Charity. As I do not think, that if I am bidden to a Feaſt ſometime before, or have allowed my ſelf any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Recreation, that this ſhall unfit me for the Chriſtian Paſſeover. But withal I muſt ſay, that were it put to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63922:28"/>my choice, I would rather omit thoſe Civilities, and deny my ſelf thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at that time, than loſe my ſpiritual Advantages: And I would avoid all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of being angry, or doing any thing that might but give ſuſpicion that I were not thorowly reconciled to all the world, rather than at ſuch a critical time to make my ſelf an Offender: <hi>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> And when I pray, as I always do when I communicate, I am enjoin'd <hi>to lift up pure hands without wrath or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> No worldly care therefore, nor the entertainment of friends, nor a ſmall fit of ſickneſs, that does not confine me to my bed, or chamber, ſhall ever hinder my approaches to God's Altar, nor every little quarrel, which againſt my will I am engaged in, when I am ready to make ſatisfaction, if I have given Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and to forgive, if I have taken any. For ſhall I rob my ſelf of Gods be ſſing, becauſe another man is froward, ſtubborn, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable? The caſe therefore of

                     <p n="5">5. But if I ſin after ſo ſolemn a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of my Vows in this Sacrament, will it not increaſe my guilt? So among the Ancients ſome deferr'd their Baptiſm till the time of their death, that they might not be impeacht of defiling the White Robes which they then put on. And does not this Argument equally hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the performance of all other Offices of Chriſtianity? May I not as well defer to repent, ſince a relapſe into evil habits, after ſuch an ab-renunciation of them, is an heavy aggravation of my Crime?
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63922:29"/>And is not this to do as it is reported of the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> who follow their Thievery till they are Sixty, and then ſpend the remainder of their days in Prayers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting their Youth and Strength to the Devil, and their Vices; their Old Age, Impotence, and Diſeaſes to God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? But what if death ſhould ſeize me while I thus defer making up my accounts with my Maſter? What if a dull Lethargy (which perhaps is but the effect and puniſhment of my irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) ſhould ſeize my brain, and ſtifle the ſpirits, and diſable me from thinking? So that by reaſon thereof I am dead while I live. What if a <hi>Fever</hi> ſhould captivate my Reaſon, and put me into a Frenzy, ſo as I can only name God in my Oaths and Curſes; will not this hinder all commerce with God, or my own Soul? And how deplorable muſt my eſtate then be? For Heaven was never deſign'd a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> a Receptacle for the Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and Vicious. How can I promiſe my ſelf to repent, or communicate to morrow, who put off hearkening to my Saviour to day, ſince all his injunctions relate to the preſent time? And if that that muſt ſave me, be a work of Grace,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63922:29"/>of time, and perſeverance, what folly is it to neglect it? And will not the ſlighting theſe paſſionate and earneſt invitations of my God, be a great increaſe of my guilt?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But does not Satan ſometimes tempt me to think it unlawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with ſinners, or, as it is worded, with a mixt company? And am not I my ſelf the greateſt ſinner? And who can come there who is not ſo? And does not our Church, as well as all other the Reformed, debar all groſs and notorious tranſgreſſors from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Can I call this any thing but Cunning in my ghoſtly Enemy, who firſt tempts me to mean thoughts of my ſelf, and would keep me from God's Table, becauſe my ſelf am unworthy; and now tempts me to pride, and contempt of my Chriſtian brother? I am ſure <hi>Charity thinks no evil,</hi> and obliges us <hi>in honour to prefer others to our ſelves.</hi> Beſides, why do I pray, or hear with ſinners, if I muſt not communicate with them? And how do I know but he who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended deeply yeſterday, is as deep a penitent to day? And how dare <hi>I to judg anothers ſervant?</hi> It is not in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63922:30"/>diſeaſes of the ſoul as of thoſe of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?

                     <p>Laſtly: But is not the poſture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, apt to give ſcandal, and to be miſtaken for an act of worſhip perform'd not to God, but to the Elements? I am ſure Humility is a neceſſary Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the worthy Communicant; a Vertue which is peculiarly Chriſtian, which the Philoſophers do not ſo much as name in their Catalogues. I know alſo, that when I communicate, the Prieſt prays, that <hi>the body and blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may preſerve my body and ſoul unto eternal life;</hi> and with him I pray when I ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> and the poſture of prayer is kneeling; and therefore I <hi>fall down, and worſhip before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Perhaps our Saviour gave the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63922:30"/>bleſſed Euchariſt to his Apoſtles in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſture (for we are not ſure, becauſe the Scripture is ſilent); and ſo alſo did he give it only to men (when there were many Female Diſciples), and in an upper room, and after a Feaſt (as it was alſo in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time celebrated after the <hi>Love-Feaſt,</hi> or <hi>Agape).</hi> But hath not the Church as much power as the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue?

For can we think, that our Saviour's practice binds more than God's expreſs command? Or does it bind more in one circumſtance than in others?

Every man is naturally convinc'd, that ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63922:37"/>actions are breaches of the Laws of God; And therefore in ſuch caſes there is no need of Trial, as to the fact, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a fault or not.

As to my leſſer tranſgreſſions, my Negligences, the forgetfulneſs of my Vows, and the defects of holy Performances, I am to experiment, whether I might not have been more diligent, and more devout, and whether my ſins of infirmity be not rather owing to my ſloth, than the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Nature, or the weakneſs of my Graces? I am alſo to examine, whether many of my Reputed Vertues be not Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whether I have not conſulted my own intereſt, or ſecular applauſe, more than the honour of God? how dull and cold I have been in my devotion, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in the Offices of Charity, and how ſlightly I have ſet about the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?

For the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> who were not baptized, had Faith; and ſo had thoſe who were in a ſtate of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and yet their Faith was not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63922:39"/>thought ſufficient to intitle them to the Priviledges of God's Table: For Faith is not ſo much an affiance in God, as a giving credit to his Revealed Will, as it is a body of Laws adapted to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of God's Honour, and our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Therefore when I ſay, <hi>I believe,</hi> I mean, I reſolve to live according to thoſe injunctions; that I take Jeſus for my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and expect to ſhare in the benefits of his Death and Reſurrection, no further than I obey his will.</p>
                     <p>I muſt alſo further examine; Am I in perfect Charity? Is my hope firm, and my love to Jeſus unalterable? Do I as earneſtly long for this ſpiritual food, as I do for my daily ſuſtenance? And could I be content rather to want the Neceſſaries of life, than to be deprived of the Bread of God? And do I bear in mind the doom of thoſe who ſlighted the divine Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and would not come; and of him who intruded, not having the Wedding-garment? Theſe, and many other ſuch Queſtions, are neceſſary to make this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Self-examination advantageous: For nothing leſs than the ſtricteſt ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, can make a worthy Communicant. It was therefore an excellent Obſervation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63922:39"/>of the Ancients, <hi>That the preparation for the Holy Euchariſt, ſhould be as ſtrict and compleat, as our preparation for our diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and that I ſhould no more dare to appear before God's Table with any known ſin unmortified, than I ſhould dare to appear before his Tribunal with it.

I am not concern'd about matters of curioſity, and of light value; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the moſt momentous affairs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, about my Souls health, and eternity. I do not therefore puzzle my ſelf with little queſtions; nor do I diſpute, what are the exact dimenſions of the Kingdom of darkneſs, where it is, and what different Climates are in it; but the queſtion is, whether Heaven and Hell be real, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary places? Whether the Judicature of Conſcience ſignifie any thing in this world, or the Tribunal of Chriſt in that which is to come? Can I dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, and a conſuming fire, where the torments are infinite in their height, and infinite in their duration? Is not depending on a death-bed-Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, a deceiving of our ſelves? And if ſo, what ſhall I do now, that when I go hence I may die in God's favour? What
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63922:40"/>ſhall I do to be ſaved? This is a terrible Interrogatory, a queſtion of weight and moment: For as no man is fit to die, but he who loves God above all things, and is in perfect charity with all Mankind; who is unconcerned with the affairs of the world, and hath learnt, and practiſed an intire Reſignation of himſelf into the hands of his Creator; whoſe accounts are adjuſted, whoſe life hath been one act of intercourſe with Heaven, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts in eternity are ſecured; ſo neither is any man fit to approach the holy Table without the like preparation.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63922:41"/>Maſter gave them admiſſion to his Table. And ſo was it alſo in the Primitive Church: For the Biſhops of old allowed every one, as ſoon as he was baptized, to come to the Holy Euchariſt, altho they carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided any diſcourſes about this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before thoſe who had never been partakers of it: And when their Subject led them that way, they ſpoke in Figures and Metaphorical Expreſſions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the underſtanding of thoſe who had communicated: For they were well perſwaded, that it was a Myſtery. Now Myſteries are not to be pryed into, but admired; not to be commonly talkt of, nor curiouſly diſputed about, but to be lookt on with Veneration and Reſpect, to be ſtudied and reverenc'd. They knew it was no ſlight and perfunctory employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to communicate with the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; but they withal knew, that a little meaſure of Knowledg, and a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Humility, Piety and Charity, would intitle to the Priviledges of God's Altar. Now all that they inſtructed the Candidates of theſe Myſteries in, was only the duties of Morality, Juſtice and Honeſty, Peaceableneſs and Compaſſion, Chaſtity and Temperance, together with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63922:41"/>an ardent love to God (only now and then they could not forbear reprehending an Heretick): And theſe were the Subjects of all the Sermons of thoſe days. And there was nothing expreſly required from the perſon who came to the <hi>Font,</hi> but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn profeſſion of the Articles of the <hi>Creed.</hi> And upon this profeſſion the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen</hi> was baptized; and after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, immediately admitted to the Lord's Supper. When therefore I know and underſtand, that our bleſſed Saviour, by his precious Death, ſealed a Covenant with God in the behalf of Mankind; and that I have ſolemnly in my Baptiſm, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my part of that agreement, reſolving no further to depend on his Merits, than I obey his Laws: When I underſtand, that I muſt be truly penitent for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Offences, and ought to live better for the future: when I believe all Gods promiſes of Mercy and Salvation made to me in Chriſt Jeſus, and am convinc'd, that I ought to be thankful for that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to God, and charitable to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; then, I ſuppoſe, I have knowledg enough to intitle me to this Ordinance: For if my ſearch after knowledg, ſhould engage me in the Labyrinths of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63922:42"/>Schools, and I muſt not receive till I am able to demonſtrate, <hi>how Chriſt were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there,</hi> and to comprehend all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that are brought for, and againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> I might perhaps <hi>be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeeking, but I ſhould never come to the knowledg of the truth;</hi> And if I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to underſtand what I enquired after, ſhould probably be never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>For what advance hath that man made in Chriſtianity, that hath ſpent his days in the little queſtions of the <hi>School men; how one body can be hid under the accidents of another body

Or whether a Rat, when he nibbles a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Hoſt, doth communicate, and truly eat the ſubſtantial Body and Blood of Chriſt?</hi> with many other ſuch Impertinencies, to give them the ſofteſt Name. Whereas one day ſpent in the due conſideration, <hi>how I ſhall receive worthily, and how I ſhall live more piouſly,</hi> gives me more uſeful knowledg than an Age of controverſal ſtudies. That God is preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I have infallible Authority to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63922:42"/>aſſure me. Thy Word, O my Saviour, is ſufficient to command my belief; but the myſtery is enough to ſtifle my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: And to ſeek to know more than thou art willing to reveal, were to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Reverence due to thy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Authority. For how can I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſcribe ſo tranſcendent an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which the Angels themſelves ſtoop to look into? This Sacrament was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for better purpoſes, than to puzzle and confound: It was deſign'd to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and confirm; to bind us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber God and our ſelves; to remember his love, and our Returns of gratitude: For the deepeſt ſpeculations ſeldom make a man more wiſe, or more holy; but the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I am ſure, is the true method to endear me to God. The buſineſs of a good man is not to amuſe, but to prepare himſelf to communicate with his Saviour. The underſtanding of a Religious ſoul is vaſtly different from that of a great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and the Wiſdom that comes down from above, conſiſts not in Word, but in Power. I am reſolved therefore, not to meddle with the quarrels of the different parties of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> While they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63922:43"/>I will pray; while they ſacrifice their Charity to the maintenance of their Faith, I will purſue after peace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And by that means, I doubt not but I ſhall be fit to communicate here, and to ſee God in Heaven.</p>

                        <hi>If men being delighted with the beauties of the Heavenly Hoſt, took them to be Gods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: For the firſt Author of Beauty hath created them; and by the beauty and greatneſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, proportionably is the Maker of them ſeen.</hi> But it is too ſadly found true, that the love of the world grows to a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtature of a ſudden, while the love of God and Holineſs is pincht in its Infancy, and ſtarv'd in its Swath-bands: It is a Plant which ſeldom meets with a fit Soil; and when it grows up, can never be brought to maturity, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63922:49"/>beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, a plentiful portion of the dew of Heaven, and a great care to preſerve and cheriſh it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ought to love my Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have the greateſt Obligations to him: For his love to me brought him from Heaven to Earth, from a Throne to a Croſs, and thence into Hell, for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. <hi>Greater love than this hath no man ſhown, than that he ſhould lay down his life for his friend,</hi> ſaid the compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jeſus. And is there no higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, no nobler inſtance of love, O my infallible Maſter? Yes, certainly, thine was, when thou wert content to die for thine Enemies: <hi>Many waters could not quench it, and it was ſtronger than death.</hi> Now if the love of an undone world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd God's Anger, made him ſuſpend his Juſtice, and degrade his Son; ſhould not the love of God much rather engage me to conquer my Luſts? Could I die, O my beſt Friend, a thouſand times over for thee, yet ſhould I not love thee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy deſervings. But this is our great folly, and the cauſe of all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; we are ſet on fire under the <hi>Pole,</hi> and we freeze under the <hi>Aequinoctial;</hi> the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63922:50"/>world makes us paſſionate Lovers, while the Son of God cannot.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To love God is the moſt natural and eaſie of all Recompences. Shouldeſt thou, Lord, now require from me the burthenſom Attendances, and the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Sacrifices that were injoin'd under the Old Law, I could have no Reaſon to complain; but to love thee ſincerely is the cheapeſt of Returns: For when my bodily weakneſs or infirmities, will not ſuffer me to faſt, or watch, or wear ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and my poverty hinders my gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Alms, yet I am never ſo poor, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo weak, but I can love; and tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I cannot hear every day, nor pray every hour, nor communicate every week, yet nothing hinders but that I may love my God every moment; and that will bring me to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Love of God is the Fountain of acceptable Obedience; and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to my Love to God is my Zeal and my Devotion, my Reſolution and my Piety; and when once theſe Ardors cool, every thing that is good languiſhes and decays. To be affrighted, threatned and compell'd to ſerve my Maſter, is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to my Chriſtian performances, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63922:50"/>fullies all their Beauties: but it is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that God is well-pleaſed with, when the Offering is brought freely, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chearfully, and ſent up in flames to Heaven, being offered on the Altar of Love: For Jeſus is the Author of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe only who ſo love him; and the Grace of God is only with them who love his Son in ſincerity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A due Reflection upon this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a great encouragement to love him who inſtituted it; for by it we are made one Body, of which our bleſſed Saviour is the Head: And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Rites that intimated this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was the ancient uſe (nor is it yet prohibited in our Church, but left to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) to mingle Water with the Wine in the holy Chalice, to teſtifie the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union that is betwixt Chriſt and his Church: For as Water and Wine mix and incorporate, ſo are the faithful Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants made the ſame body with the Son of God: For in the Opinion of

                     <p>Beſides all which, it is further conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that of worldly things a man may love what he ſhall never enjoy; or if he happen to enjoy it, he may afterward loſe it; or the very fruition may cloy and nauſeate, which was expected to pleaſe and ſatisfie: But no man ever yet fell in love with Jeſus, and loſt his aim; no man ever yet converſt with him, but he experimented the pleaſure of ſuch amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſociety, and could be content to dwell with him for ever: And ſo ſhall the good man: For what ſhall ſeparate him from the love of Chriſt?

                     <p>When therefore I ſay, I love God, I vow and endeavour to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <p>NOW one ſolemn act of my love to God, and one great duty of the Goſpel, is to remember my beſt friend, my Saviour. And it is a particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Chriſtian Religion, that as all holy ſigns in general, are given for the confirmation of the divine promiſes, ſo the moſt ſacred Offices of the Goſpel, are proper and genuine Repreſentations of the Death and Reſurrection of that Saviour, who is the <hi>Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> and Inſtitutor of our Religion. Thus in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, the Ancients in thoſe warm Countries, dipt all who came to that Ordinance (except thoſe who were baptized on their death-beds)
<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63922:52"/>to exhibit a Memorial of our Saviour's being three days buried; and the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unleſs in caſe of Neceſſity, was at firſt celebrated but once in the year, the <hi>Catechumens</hi> being baptized

                     <p>But more eſpecially was the Euchariſt deſigned <hi>evidently to ſet before our eyes Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt crucified among us,</hi> by bringing to our remembrance the ſhame and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a dying Saviour, our merciful God applying himſelf to the moſt ductile and eaſie of all our Faculties: For our Underſtandings require much teaching; and we muſt proceed from lower me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, till we come to be capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. And what man is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wiſeſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſons, that can expound the Riddles of Providence, or the Myſteries of the written Law of God? The Will follows the guidance of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and yet when it is ſo dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it is a blind, bold, and daring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and for the moſt part ſtubbornly neglects to do its duty: But the Memory needs nothing but ſenſible Objects to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and is the ſtrongeſt and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63922:53"/>of all our Faculties, and ſuch as few men want. And in truth, every act of Obedience is but a remembrance of my duty, and every Tranſgreſſion an act of forgetfulneſs: For as often as I ſin, I ceaſe to mind a dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;

                     <p>The Sacrament therefore of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is a Commemoration of Jeſus, and his Paſſion, without which all his other performances could not ſave us: For all the Rhetorick, Eloquence, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Sermons, all his divine and beneficial Miracles, together with the unblamable and unſpotted Holineſs of his Life and Converſation, could never have been ſufficient to have redeem'd us without his Crucifixion: 'Twas his death only that was the Original of our life and ſalvation. What need then hath my dull and unaffected ſoul of ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to give my Saviour a place in my thoughts? The very performance of the duty is its own Recompence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly agrees to thoſe Notions of Vertue, that all Mankind bring with them into
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63922:53"/>the world, it being natural to every one to be thankful, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Benefactors.

For if the Picture, or the Garment of an abſent Friend puts me in mind of the perſon whoſe they were, and inclines me to grateful Reflections on my Benefactor; how much more ſhould I be obliged, when ſuch lively Repreſentations of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour executed, bleeding and dying for me, are exhibited to me, as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affords me? A Sermon may give me a paſſionate character of my crucified Redeemer, but nothing can repreſent his Paſſion ſo to the life as the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt: that is the moſt affecting preaching: For in that miniſtration his ſufferings are acted over again in the View of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63922:60"/>but have fellowſhip one with another: And to this purpoſe the ancient Church thought fit in the beginning of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-ſervice, when none were preſent but thoſe who were compleat Chriſtians, and in intire Communion with the Church in all Ordinances, to recite out of the <hi>Diptychs</hi> (which were never read but at the Altar) not only the Names of the famous Princes and Biſhops who were alive, as a teſtimony that they held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, but alſo of all the Saints departed, of the Mother of God, the Apoſtles, Martys, Confeſſors, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they might give a publick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the world, that they lived in the profeſſion of the ſame Orthodoxy for which ſome of thoſe Saints were martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in which they all died; magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name of Chriſt for his goodneſs to his Church, in calling it out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into marvellous light, and making them children of God: And whoſoever was left out of thoſe Tables, was by that Omiſſion excommunicate, as is famouſly known in the caſe of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> Since therefore all theſe holy uſages are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leſſons of Peace and Union, I will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all Schiſm as carefully as I ſhun the

And when at laſt that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod was antiquated,
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tert. Apol. cap.</hi> 39.</note> every Chriſtian was obliged once a month, or oftner, as he was willing, to give ſomewhat to the Church-Treaſury: And this money was imployed to feed the poor, to bury the dead, to maintain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63922:64"/>and to put them into a capacity to get their own living; to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the decrepit by Age or Sickneſs, to cheriſh the Shipwrack'd, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe who were condemn'd to the Mines, or baniſh'd, or caſt into priſon for the ſake of God and Religion.

                     <p>How then can any man ſatisfie himſelf that he is prepared to come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who is negligent of this duty? Do not the Myſteries exhibit to me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inſtances of my Saviour's Charity and Compaſſion? And can I be his Diſciple, unleſs I imitate his Vertues? St. <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> was ſo ſcrupulous, that when News was brought him, that a man was found dead within his Territory, he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that he died of want, and that the not timely relieving every indigent perſon, did caſt an Aſperſion on his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he for that Reaſon abſtained for ſome time from the Holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And tho I am not willing to cheriſh ſuch unneceſſary ſcruples, yet that man does very raſhly thruſt himſelf upon God, who neglects any opportunity of doing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63922:64"/>good when it is offered to him: For who can expect that his Saviour ſhould give him the dainties of his Table, who denies his crumbs to his neceſſitous brother?

                     <p>BUT it is not enough for me to love the brethren, and to do good to the Houſhold of Faith; I muſt alſo love my Enemies, and do good to them who intend my Ruin: For <hi>if ye only love them who love you, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have ye?

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63922:65"/>And if you ſalute the brethren only, what do you more than others? do not even the Publicans ſo? Be ye therefore perfect, be ye merciful, as your Father in heaven is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for be makes his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſends rain on the juſt and on the unjust.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour therefore ſays to me, and to all his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you, that you may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your Father which is in heaven.</hi> This is the perfection of Vertue; this the glory of our Chriſtian profeſſion; and herein do the Laws of our bleſſed Maſter out do all other Schemes of Morality:
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Tert. ad Scapul. Athenag. Legat.</hi> &amp;c.</note> Nor could either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to ſo ſublime a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of compaſſion, which is truly Evangelical, and a Leſſon only learnt in the School of Chriſt. And therefore the Confeſſor at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom <hi>Caſſianus</hi> mentions, anſwered like himſelf, when his <hi>Heathen</hi> Adverſaries pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him with all ſort of Contumely and Reproaches, and at laſt diſdainfully ask'd him, <hi>What Miracle did your Maſter Chriſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63922:66"/>ever do?</hi> When he made this Return, <hi>It is no mean Miracle that he hath wrought in me, that I can tamely hear your Reproaches, and not be concern'd at the Injury;</hi> that I can ſuffer you to revile me, and can at the ſame time bleſs and ſpeak well of you.</p>
                     <p>At this Sacrament I commemorate the Death of my Redeemer, who died for his Enemies, and offer'd his Merits to thoſe who crucified him, as well as to thoſe who oblig'd him. And this is that particular Accompliſhment of the Divinity, that is propoſed to our imitation: For whereas an attempt to be like God in Power and Majeſty, degraded <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Angels; and Reſolves to attain to the degree of wiſdom which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor poſſeſſes, baniſh'd <hi>Adam,</hi> and undid his poſterity; the tranſcribing the copy of the divine goodneſs and compaſſion, will re-inſtate the world into a better Paradiſe, and give men the place which the Fallen Spirits deſerted. Nay, many times an act of mercy proves ſucceſsful beyond expectation, and delivers an Adverſary not only from temporal wants, but from eternal horrors: And I may make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of that Enemy whom I pity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63922:66"/>And if to know the art of true Charity be a greater priviledg than to be crown'd with the Majeſty of Kings, then to convert a ſoul is a nobler Alms than to give a Million of money to the ſtock of the poor.</p>
                     <p>And it is very remarkable, that our Saviour hath not only made this duty of forgiving Injuries
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12, 14, 15.</note> a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſible qualification, to fit me for the receiving of God's pardon; but ſeems to imply, that upon one act of Obſtinacy, one Refuſal to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey this Injunction, my former ſins, that have already been forgiven me, ſhall be brought again to remembrance, and be the cauſe of my condemnation: For when in the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.27, 34.</note> Parable, ten thouſand Talents were remitted to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled Servant by his Lord, and the Obligation cancell'd; yet when the ſame Servant dealt unmercifully with his Fellow ſervant, his Lord delivered him to the Tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him: <hi>And ſo ſhall our Heavenly. Father do to us, if we from our hearts forgive not every one his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their treſpaſſes.</hi>

                     <p>And for this Reaſon, I cannot but think it a commendable cuſtom in <hi>the Greek</hi> Church, in which, during the celebration of this Office, not only the Deacon; who aſſiſts, begs pardon of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prieſt, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Liturgy injoins
<note n="*" place="margin">Smyth<hi>'s Acc. of the</hi> Greek <hi>Church. p.</hi> 143.</note>, but the Prieſt who conſecrates, takes care to reconcile himſelf before he approaches the Altar; and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Prieſts alſo bow toward the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as an inſtance of their begging forgiveneſs, if they have offended any one there preſent: After which every Lay Communicant immediately before he receives, ſays aloud, <hi>Chriſtians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi> to which the Congregation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>God ſhall forgive you.</hi> And in the Primitive Church the Deacon was bound to ſay aloud, <hi>Let no man who is not in perfect Charity, dare to approach this Table.</hi> And the better to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Churches Reſolutions in this caſe, as <hi>Eaſter</hi> was the moſt ſolemn time of giving the Euchariſt, ſo in the foregoing week, on <hi>Maundy Thurſday,</hi> the Penitents were ſolemnly admitted to Communion: For whereas on that

                     <p>I therefore think my ſelf bound to pray as heartily for my moſt malicious enemies, as for my own ſalvation And I cannot but remark the folly of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> who, tho they ſay all the reſt of their prayers on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> kneeling, do alter that poſture when they pray for the <hi>Jews</hi> (as they alſo omit ſaying the <hi>Amen),</hi> and that for theſe poor

                     <p>So that if I conſider my Relation to the reſt of the world, either as a Man, or a Chriſtian, I cannot but account my Adverſaries (whether they be ſo to my perſon or principles) in the number of my Friends, and ſuch as do me good: For by envious exclaiming againſt my Irregularities, they engage me to more circumſpection and greater care in performing my duty to my God, the world and my ſelf. And they give me occaſion to manifeſt my Patience, my Humility, and Self-denial, with many

Nor can any man conceive a degree of Obedience beyond this.</q> This was his Glory. Nor did it leſſen his Excellencies or his Happineſs: For notwithſtanding this his Humiliation, he was always glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and always bleſt; as the Angels, when they leave the Throne of God, and come down on Earth, carry their Heaven with them, or rather find a new one in their Obedience.</p>
                     <p>And ought not I to learn of this our great High Prieſt, not to remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, or to curb the winds; not to feed five thouſand by Miracle, or to raiſe the dead, but to be humble and meek, to deny my ſelf, and to depend on God? How ſhould this Love of Chriſt conſtrain me?

                     <p>And tho perhaps my portion may be ſevere, and my province difficult, yet I cannot expect to be better treated, when my Maſter's Cup was ſo imbitter'd. It could not be expected, that our Redeemer ſhould love his Diſciples better than his Father loved him, who was his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and beloved Son. But when God loved thee moſt ardently, O my Saviour, he inured thee to labours and ſufferings, to great conflicts and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And thus he

For ſuch a ſacrifice became us; and his ſufferings were a great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Innocence: For not only the Blood of the Oblation was firſt let out at the foot of the Altar, to emblem the mortification of our paſſions before we approach our Maker; but it was alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that every beaſt was not thought
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63922:76"/>fit to make a Sacrifice: Sheep and Doves, Creatures famous for their harmleſneſs and their purity, for their innocence and their tenderneſs, were deſtin'd to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, while Dogs and Swine, and other creatures that delight in Rapine or Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were baniſht from God's Houſe. And can I expect to communicate with my <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Kingdom, who refuſe to ſhare with him in his ſufferings? How unreaſonable is it to expect, how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be conform'd to his Aſcention and Triumphs, without a conformity to his Indignities and Paſſion, to his Agonies and Crucifixion? For that Text, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> is a Prophecy as well as a Precept; and ſo muſt be fulfill'd in the Church as long as it hath a being; and every good man muſt do what St. <hi>Francis</hi> and others are only feign'd to do; <hi>he muſt bear about in his body the marks of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>

So true, and ſo hearty ſhould my joy be, as that which a new Convert experiments, who hath been lately reſcued from a ſtate of folly and fear, and admitted into the number of the Sons of God. Or rather it ſhould match the mirth of Nuptials: For in this Sacrament is my Soul married to my Holy Redeemer: Nay, my inward ſatisfactions ſhould expreſs themſelves, as a victorious Army glories in its Conqueſts; every noiſe ſhould be a ſhout, and every ſentence a part of a triumphant ſong: For my deareſt Saviour, by his Death,

                     <p>Such a demeanor agrees to the practiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who injoyed but a ſhadow of this bleſſed Sacrament: It agrees to our bleſſed Maſter's actions at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, to the Nature of the Ordinance, and to the Cuſtoms of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63922:84"/>that he, who did in other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies comply with the injunctions of the Synagogue, would not in this particular be ſingular; and therefore are apt to believe,

                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 14 26.</note> that the Hymn which he ſung before he went out to the Mount of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> was the great <hi>Hallel:</hi> But if it were not the ſame, it was, doubtleſs, ſome Laud to the Almighty, as for all his Benefits, ſo particularly for his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this is highly worth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that when Jeſus ſung this Hymn, it was the <hi>Eve</hi> to his cruel and unparallel'd Tragedy, that the Man of Sorrows, who all his life long did eat the bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and quench his thirſt with his tears, having the Croſs in view, ſung an Hymn.

                     <p>BUT above all men,
<note place="margin">I hope my Brethren of the Clergy will not take it amiſs that I have inſerted this Chapter; I did not deſign it to inſtruct them, they are the Angels of God; but to direct and guide my ſelf in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office.</note> Gods Miniſter, who conſecrates, ought to be careful that he be duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the purity of his intention, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſelf-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſelf-denial, in Humility and true joy; for Jeſus who inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Myſteries, was a <hi>holy and innocent High-prieſt, and ſeparate from ſinners:</hi> And tho it be no wonder that <hi>Judas</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, yet it is monſter when <hi>Judas</hi> conſecrates; to ſee dogs and ſwine, and other unclean beaſts wallow and delight
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63922:89"/>in filth and pollution, is common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; but to ſee Ermins defiled, is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. To behold one of the <hi>Sons of Belial</hi> making haſte to be damned, is an uſual, tho deplorable ſight; but to ſee an Angel fall into the condemnation of Satan, to behold one of the Sons of God turn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate, and to make a League with the Powers of Darkneſs, is a reverſing of the methods of Nature and Providence, and a defiance to the conſtitutions of Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>Shall I take the immaculate Body of my Saviour into a polluted Mouth, and think to conſecrate his Blood with profane Lips? Ought I not to <hi>waſh my hands in innocency, before I compaſs the Altar of God?</hi> before I receive Jeſus for my ſelf, and give him in to the hands of others? It was given in charge to the Prieſts of the Old Law, <hi>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy;</hi> Nor can that Commandment be antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the Goſpel: Nay, the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Conſtitutions required, that the Prieſt ſhould not only be free from any inward Pollution, but alſo that he ſhould have no

                     <p>For if a Phyſician of the body gives no encouragement to his Patient to depend on his skill, unleſs himſelf be of a vigorous conſtitution, and a healthy look (ſince all his Diſcourſe of keeping others alive for ever, will appear but empty talk, and vain boaſt, if his own livid Countenance and decayed Limbs are a contradiction to his confidence) how much more ought thoſe who take on them the Cure of Souls, to

                     <p>Who, O my Soul, dares ſpeak evil of that Prieſt, who ſpends all his Time and Strength in the ſervice of that God whom he acknowledges? and who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that Clergy-man, who buſies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in viſiting the ſick, in inſtructing the ignorant, in reclaiming the profligate, in comforting the diſconſolate, in diligent Preaching and Catechizing, and in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Adminiſtration of the Sacraments? There is a natural Veneration and Reſpect that all men pay to that which is truly Religious; but when he who inſtructs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, never preaches to himſelf, this caſts an odium on Chriſtianity, that is not eaſily defac't; for a wicked Prieſt at the Altar is worſe than <hi>Judas;</hi> for when <hi>Judas</hi> kiſt, and then betrayed our Bleſſed Saviour, tho the action was as he intended it, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet as God applied it, it became the Inſtrument of the World's Happineſs; but when the vicious Prieſt approaches God's Table, and puts the Body of Jeſus into his own Lips, and the hands of his people, he prophanes the tremendous Sacrament, he affronts the Majeſty of God, he does no good to himſelf or others, but much harm; he eats and drinks Damnation to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63922:91"/>himſelf, and gives a very evil Example to his Neighbours; and what Power can bring any good out of ſo much Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                     <p>And yet to ſin like <hi>Judas,</hi> is to be a vile and notorious Tranſgreſſor; and the caſe of that Traytor is an affrighting Example; our Holy Redeemer had given him his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, tho he knew he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, that he might attempt all methods to reclaim him, to ſoften his hard Heart by Kindneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, and to ſecure him from the Temptations of Satan by arming him with the power of God, and the Grace that is conveyed with thoſe Myſteries; but <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was the firſt Inſtance, that the Holy Sacrament, which the Son of God inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the Conſolation and Welfare of his Servants, may become the occaſion of Condemnation to thoſe who receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, and that the Devil may enter into that Man's mind, whoſe Body hath received the Lord Jeſus: and how impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wicked doth ſuch a Wretch grow of a ſudden? for when our Maſter had declared, that one of his Family would be that Traytor, who ſhould deliver him

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63922:92"/>mix their Voices with his, and all the Space round the Altar, is filled with the Bleſſed Spirits who honour him that is there repreſented, and incircle his Body, as Guards do a Prince.</q> Nay, ſo great is the Honour that is done to a good Prieſt, when he adminiſters in Holy Things, that he ſtands in Gods ſtead; for as God offer'd up his only Begotten Son for the Redemption of the World: So doth the Prieſt at the Altar make a Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that one perfect and intire Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Oblation of our Holy Saviour for the ſins of Mankind; and was it ever known, that any man durſt play the Devil in the likeneſs of God?

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63922:107"/>to eat of his Maſters Bread; they gave it to dying perſons, when they viſited the ſick; and they gave it to them who were alive, when a Funeral happened.</p>

                        <p>WHen our bleſſed Saviour made his publick appearance in the World, every thing in him was excellent, and extraordinary; the Lineaments of his Face ſo beautiful, that he was juſtly ſtiled the faireſt of ten thouſand; but the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of his Soul were ſo miraculous, that whatever of great or good could be obſerved either in Men or Angels, was but a faint Repreſentation of his more ſtupendious Accompliſhments; the charms of his Countenance were moſt taking, the Eloquence and Reaſon of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes moſt perſuaſive; but the Holineſs of his Converſation was tranſcendent; inſomuch that his Friends loved, and his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enemies, tho they hated him, could not but admire him; his converſe was freeand obliging, his pity generous and noble; he accounted that day loſt, wherein he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63922:120"/>had not done ſome kindneſs; and was grieved to ſend any man away from him ſorrowful. He often neglected to mind himſelf, but he never omitted his care of the Poor; and he, who had no houſe to reſide in, no maintenance but the Alms of well-inclined People, had yet a Bag, and a Treaſury for the indigent; he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forgot to eat, but he never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to Pray: ſo wonderful was his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſo univerſal his Charity, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable his Obedience. His Soul was the Temple of Chaſtity and Temperance, the ſeat of Prudence, the fortreſs of Courage, the Throne of Juſtice, the ſtorehouſe of Humanity, the Sanctuary of Meekneſs; in a word, it was the reſidence of all Virtues; and who could converſe with ſuch a Saviour, and refuſe to Love, and Adore him? But never were his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments ſo Illuſtrious, as when he took his laſt journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when all the Scenes of Treachery and Cruelty were to end in the unparallel'd Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Son of God: then he exerted all his Vigor, for then the Son of God was to be glorified, and to be manifeſted to be the only begotten of the Father, with Power, according to the Spirit of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63922:120"/>Holineſs by the Reſurrection from the Dead; for his ſufferings were his own crown, and the cauſe of the worlds Salvation Perillous was the attempt, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant was invincible. His firſt Eſſay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the compleating of our redemption, was on <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> on this day of the week he made his entry into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> like a Conqueror or rather like the King of the World; from hence I date the <hi>Epocha</hi> of his Crucifixion, becauſe on this day among the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb was ſeparated from the reſt of the Flock, and with much ſolemnity brought up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in order to its being Sacrificed; and on this day of the week alſo he made a more pompous entry into the Holy City, when attended by many Saints returning from their Graves to accompany his Reſurrection; he made it appear, that he had ſpoiled Hell, and ſaved mankind; both which entries were made in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all the Oppoſition of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> his implacable Enemies. And where, O my Soul, ſhouldſt thou wiſh thy ſelf a place, but among the Train of this Omnipotent Victor? Thou haſt been by him raiſed from a ſad eſtate, from being dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63922:121"/>and whom ſhouldſt thou Love, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, but thy beſt Friend? I will follow him therefore into the High-prieſt's Palace, and to the Judgment-ſeat of <hi>Pilate;</hi> I will go with him to Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> and there I will dye with him; but firſt I will view his Triumphs, and admire his Grandeur; I will firſt accompany him to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, and then to the Chriſtian Altar, that is, to the Croſs, on which he was Offered as a Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh.</p>
                        <p>From the Eaſt came the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (for on that ſide of the City lay <hi>Bethany</hi>) and rejoyced like a Giant to run his courſe, tho he foreſaw he ſhould ſuffer a diſmal Eclipſe; and in this alſo he might be likened to the Sun, that he appeared greater, and ſhone brighter than ordinary, juſt before his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 'Twas required by the Moſaical Law, that every Male ſhould appear at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> three times a Year; nor would <hi>Jeſus</hi> be (tho he was) exempted from thoſe attendances; for thus it behoved him to fulfil all righteouſneſs; and in this he was ſo punctual, that the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which the Chriſtian World hath, how long our Savior lived, appears from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63922:121"/>the Evangeliſts recording how many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovers he kept: The paſt years of his Life he went up to the Houſe of God in a State of Privacy, but now he reſolves to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the City like a Prince, that is, like himſelf: But where is the Ceremony of this Royal Parade? Where is the Gilt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot? Where the Purple Robes? Where are the Armed Lifeguards, and where the Retinue of Nobles? Is the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> no better equip't than with an Aſs, and that Aſs borrowed? Are his moſt Eminent Courtiers but Twelve poor <hi>Galileans,</hi> moſt of which were Fiſhermen, and one a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican?</hi> And hath he no other Followers but the Multitude, the Dregs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? 'Tis no Wonder, that at this ſight all the People were moved: Never was Prince in Exile worſe attended? And can this be the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Is this the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> But remember, O my ſoul, that all this was Prophecy, and no word of God is ever unfulfilled; his Poverty was a ſign to the Shepherds to know him by at his Birth; and the ſame ſign is given to the Holy City at his Death;

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63922:122"/>and one that brings Salvation; but he comes in a ſtate of Humility, riding upon an Aſs, and a Colt the Fole of an Aſs; and muſt God falſifie his Word to comply with our impertinent notions of Greatneſs? And is not the Condeſcention an Emblem of his Meekneſs? He came into the world to conquer, not by the Sword, but by the Croſs; not by fighting, but by dying; and does not this Aſs denote his Contempt of the World, and the lowlineſs of his Mind? How mild and good, and how benign he ſhould be, even to his worſt Adverſaries? Beſides, it was neceſſary his firſt coming into the World ſhould be diſtinguiſh't from his ſecond coming to Judgment: Nor was this but an addition to his Honour, that the firſt Confeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion, were not many mighty, not many wiſe, not the Kings, or the Generals, or the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of the World, but a few abject and contemptible men, rude and unaſſiſted, ill-clad and unlearned; and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the World: But this is not all: ſee ſomething that compleats the Wonder; for could there be a greater inſtance of my Bleſſed Saviours Divinity than this, That notwithſtanding the warineſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Gariſon, who to ſecure the Imperial Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63922:122"/>to <hi>Judea</hi> were ready to take Fire upon the notice of a new Kings Arrival as a Competitor of the Government; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Spite, Malice, and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Phariſees, Jeſus</hi> makes this Triumphant Entry, preaches in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, caſts out the Buyers and Sellers, and works many Miracles without any diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; this was certainly the Finger of God, and a Specimen of the Divine Power. Be not therefore ſcandalized, O my ſoul; this poor Saviour is the Son of God, and the Redeemer of the World, and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is his Churches Patrimony; and this is the Day which many Kings and Prophets have long'd for, but never could ſee; joyn thy ſelf therefore to the Company; and ſing thy <hi>Hoſannahs</hi> alſo to the Lord of Life and Glory? 'Tis ſhameful to ſlight thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when the Multitude admires him.</p>
                        <p>Of the People, ſome followed <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Bethany,</hi> while others met him from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> both joining together in one Company, of which, ſome went before him, others followod the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who rode in the midſt of them, under whom they ſpread their Garments in they way (as was the Cuſtom of many Nations, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained their Princes) and ſtrowed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63922:123"/>Flowers and Leaves (for ſo were Monarchs alſo treated at their Entrance into any Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the People meeting them, and carrying Lawrel and Roſes in their Hands, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſtreets with them, by which they teſtified their acknowledgment and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Sovereigns Authority) and probably the <hi>Jews</hi> coming immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> carryed Olive-Branches in their hands (as other Nations uſed to do on ſuch ſolemnities) Emblems of Peace and Union between a Prince and his Subjects, and ſigns how ready great Perſons ſhould be to forgive Injuries; after which manner they alſo carried Palms, as a good Omen of Victory: And all this was done at this time, to denote that the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was now come to his own City of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> a Meek and a Compaſſionate Saviour, and ready to triumph over the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the other Enemies of Mankind. To him therefore the people ſung their <hi>Hoſannahs,</hi> wiſhing him all happineſs, and themſelves all happy in him: <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</hi> 
                           <q rend="margQuotes">'Moſt acceptable is his Perſon, moſt welcome is his Reign and Kingdom; <hi>Hoſannah in the higheſt:</hi> Let our Shouts reach Heaven:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63922:123"/>'Tis the God who dwells there, whom we praiſe; and may that God, whoſe Throne is there, make us eternally happy in this Son of his Love; Peace in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Glory in the higheſt, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come,</q> and our Fears are at an end: And who would not joyn in Conſort to this Heavenly Song? 'Tis one of the Anthems of the Angels, and ſome of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which God's Palace will afford us: The joy ought to dilate my ſoul, tho it did not ſwell my Saviour; and this alſo was another argument, that he was the Son of God, and the Lord of Glory; that this extraordinary reception did not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, but with the ſame evenneſs of temper he enjoys all the various diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence, his poverty never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt him, his diſgraces never ruffled his quiet, nor can honours and pomp make him proud and inſolent.</p>
                        <p>But that which made no impreſſion on the Son of God, made a very deep one upon the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> for envy is a buſie and reſtleſs Vice; they, when they ſaw they could not curb the multitude, would have put our Saviour upon checking and repreſſing them: for as the covetous man cannot endure: a diſcourſe of voluntary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63922:124"/>poverty, nor the laſcivious perſon a lecture of Chaſtity; as you raiſe the paſſion of the Oppreſſor, when you preach to him the Laws of Juſtice, and inflame the froward and the cruel, when you urge him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Injuries, and to love his Enemies; ſo to the proud and ambitious nothing is ſo killing a ſight as another mans Honour: But <hi>Jeſus</hi> tells them, the meeting was not procured by craft, nor were the people flattered (much leſs affrighted) into the combination; the Oblation of Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving was voluntary, and an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a prophecy, God now intending <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings to perfect praiſe</hi> (for Virtue makes it ſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers where ever it goes) and ſhould theſe people hold their peace, the very ſtones would cry out, and who dares check the Holy Spirit, and fight againſt God? But what need of all this complaint? have patience, O ye Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the people will anſwer your deſires, ſuch is the vanity of all worldly fruitions, they, who to day cry <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> ſhall in a few days cry louder, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> Now they ſing, <hi>Bleſſed is the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord;</hi> and anon, <hi>We have no other King but Caeſar.</hi> Now
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63922:124"/>they ſpread their Garments in the way, but then they ſhall ſtrip him of his own rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now they bleſs, and cry, <hi>Maſter,</hi> but then they ſhall curſe and deſpiſe him; ſuch is all Secular Pomp and Humane Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, it depends upon popular Breatu, which, when it turns like the Wind, it blows back again, and carries away all that before it brought.</p>
                        <p>Upon foreſight of this ſad ſinful Change, ſee the Marks of a deep Sorrow on the Face of Chriſt amidſt all the Acclamations and other Teſtimonies of Publick Joy; <hi>Jeſus</hi> (the Prince of Peace) was now at the foot of the Mount of <hi>Olives.</hi> (the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of peace) in view of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (whoſe name implies the Viſion of Peace) and yet he knowing their ſins, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing God's Judgments, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Tears, and the terrible denunciation of the Divine Vengeance upon that City, that was now become the ſink of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and yet this weeping was but the Prologue to the mightier grief of his upon the Croſs, to which no ſorrow could be compared, when he offered up Prayers and Supplications to his and our Father, with ſtrong Crys and Tears, and was heard for that his Piety. Now he mourns only the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63922:125"/>fate of one City, of one People, but then he wept over and dyed for the ſins of the whole World of Diſobedient and deſperate Wretches, who doted upon ruin; all the Honour that could be given him, all the Grandeur that could ſurround him, gave him no Pleaſure in this Triumphant Entry, while he ſaw the end of his deſigned death fruſtrated, and a whole Nation obſtinate to be undone, when the Son of God was moſt willing and moſt buſie to ſave them: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Drop was of more Value than a Pearl, and the Streams that ran down his Sacred cheeks, more precious than thoſe Waters which bring down Gold from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountains. And does my Saviour weep, and can I dare to indulge to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Laughter? Can I rejoice when he is covered with Sorrows? Or live in ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when the chaſtiſement of my peace is upon him? God forbid. Now therefore, O my Soul, contemplate thy Saviour in all his Offices; in his Triumphs he ſhows himſelf a Prince; in his Mourning over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he acts the part of a Prieſt, whoſe Office it is to weep over and atone for the ſins of the People; and how does he declare himſelf to be a Prophet, when he foretels the preciſe time of the ruin of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63922:125"/>the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, before the preſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould paſs away?</p>
                        <p>In this diſconſolate plight does our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Redeemer draw nigh to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and to let the world know that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world, he balks the direct way over the Brook <hi>Kedron,</hi> to the fortreſs of <hi>Zion,</hi> and diverting, paſſes through the Sheepgate which led to the Houſe of God; he goes not up to the Palace of the High-Prieſt, nor to the Court of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, but immediately haſtens to the Temple, to teach us to begin every Action with God, and to love the place where his Honour dwells, more than all the Tents of ungodlineſs; to love the Gates of <hi>Zion</hi> more than all the dwellings of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and to aſſure us, that he who would meet God comfortably, muſt enquire for him in his Temple: For where ſhould I ſeek for thee, O my dear Saviour; where ſhould I find thee, but in thy Father's Houſe? The Temple is thy Palace, and the Chair of <hi>Moſes</hi> thy Throne, thence thou didſt baffle the Doctors, and from thence didſt thou diſpence the Oracles of Heaven to the world, reſcuing the Doctrines of Religion from the Traditions, and the Duties of it from the evil practices of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63922:126"/>and to demonſtrate, that thy complaint of them was not without cauſe, thence didſt thou drive the buyers and ſellers, ſuch was thy Zeal for the Habitation of God, when the Lord came to his Holy Temple; and who could ſtand before thee, when thou didſt thus appear like a Refiner's Fire, and like Fuller's Soap? Thus when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is begun at the houſe of God, there is great hope that the reſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will eaſily be reform'd.</p>
                        <p>At this Viſitation, <hi>Jeſus</hi> beheld all Things, not for Curioſity, but to ſee what was amiſs, and needed amendment; he lookt into all the Corners of the Temple, and diligently attended to all the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the Prieſts in their ſeveral ſtations, how they kept up the Reputation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, how exactly they performed all their Service, a fit Employment for the great High Prieſt, and Biſhop of Souls. But why all this Severity? Why the Buyers and Sellers baniſht? VVhy the Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers Banks overthrown? Were not the <hi>Jews</hi> obliged to come Three times a Year to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And when they came, were they to come empty? Now to bring with them from the remoteſt parts of <hi>Judea,</hi> Sheep and Oxen, and the firſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63922:126"/>fruits of their Cattel, VVine and Oyl, with orther Offerings, was very troubleſom; and to diſpoſe of thoſe things in kind in the Countrey, and turning them into Money to buy the like at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was not only reaſonable, but agreable to the Divine Command; and for this purpoſe had the <hi>Jews</hi> their Markets and Banks,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.24, 25.</note> in or near their Temples, as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> alſo had. Now the Practice having the countenance of a Law, and tending ſo much to the eaſe of the People, and to the Honour of God alſo, inviting all occaſional Comers to buy, and offer liberal Sacrifices (as an Exchange tempts Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers); it alſo making proviſion for Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites and ſtrangers, of ſuch Money as was current at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which only was to be offered to the Lord, and for the poor, that they might borrow, tho not on Uſury, yet on Pawn, ſo as they might not come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empty handed before the Lord; the place of this Traffick being only the outer Court of the Temple, into which were admitted even the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Uncircumciſed? why was our Maſters Zeal ſo Fervent? With great Reaſon doubtleſs was this done, for all that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did, was by the guidance of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63922:127"/>the Infallible Spirit; nor was it without reaſon that this Action was called the greateſt of our Saviour's Miracles, and one of the moſt ſolemn Declarations, that he was the Son of God.</p>
                        <p>VVas it not a great Affront to the Divine Majeſty, to make a Butchers ſtall, or a Bankers ſhop, of his Houſe? To alienate it from its right uſe; and inſtead of a houſe of Prayer, to make it a den of Thieves, of Publicans and Extortioners, and of the Practicers of the Arts of Fraud, and the Methods of Cheating? VVas it not Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to ſerve the Ends of Covetouſneſs, more than the deſigns of Piety? For theſe Markets were at firſt held only near the Temple; but at laſt, through the greedineſs of the Prieſts were brought into the firſt Court of it, to their no little gain, while they managed the Markets, either by their own ſervants, or by exacting a Tribute of all thoſe who there erected ſtalls, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſelling one and the ſame ſacrifice over and again, to ſeveral Perſons: Now what could create in mens minds mean thoughts of Religion, and depreciate the ſervice of the Almighty, if ſuch Actions did not? And how could men chuſe but abhor the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord? This therefore incited
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63922:127"/>the Zeal of our deareſt Lord; and it was a ſad Omen, that the Prieſts themſelves ſhould in a little time be baniſht from the Houſe of God, and turn'd out of his ſervice, becauſe they had corrupted and huxter'd the VVord of God, and handled it deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And now, O my ſoul and my body, are not you the Temple of God? And ought not the ſame meaſure of Zeal to be in me, that was in my Redeemer? Ought I not to cleanſe this Temple, and to expel thence all brutiſh Affections, all covetous thoughts, all ſelf love, and love of the VVorld, all pride and vain glory, and to keep my ſelf undefiled in the VVorld, fit for the reſidence of God, and the indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Holy Spirit; for if a man defile the Temple of God, ſhall not God deſtroy that ſinner? I will therefore devote my ſelf intirely to my Maker: what he loves ſhall be my delight, and I will honour him here in his Perſon, in his Will, in his Ordinances, in his Habitation, in his Revenue, and in every thing elſe that appertains to him, that I may hereafter enjoy him, and live with him for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Nor was the matter only of his Diſcourſes ſevere and profound (as his Knowledg was Infinite and Unlimitted) but his very manner of expreſſing himſelf had its peculiar Graces: ſometimes his talk was myſtical, and his words a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Riddle (when there being no preſent need, the Interpretation was left to the Spirit, who was to ſucceed him:) but for the moſt part he expreſſes himſelf with a becoming plaineſs, uſing Similitudes and Parables, than which there is no more ſpeedy and effectual method to inſtruct the Ignorant, who are deſirous of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but hardly drawn to purſue after that Wiſdom which is not without much Study acquired: for there cannot be a plainner, becauſe there cannot be a more familiar way of Inſtruction than this: a Parable being commonly taken from things that are ſeen, and ſo is both a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and example at once: and by that means not only makes eaſie impreſſions on the underſtanding, but as eaſily ſways the Affections: and by a certain ſecret kind of delight wins a man, before he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63922:133"/>is aware: but above all, it inſinuates a reproof without diſguſt, and cauſes a man inſenſibly to be the accuſer of his own Vices, while he condemns the like practices in another: and in this manner are the <hi>Jews</hi> treated in this Parable: our Saviour chuſing this method to induce them to a belief of his Doctrine, and an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Enormties.</p>
                        <p>Wretched and Infatuated People! whom ſalvation it ſelf cannot reſcue from ruin! Did God ever deal ſo graciouſly with any Nation as with the <hi>Jews?</hi> From a mean and ſmall Original (when they were the feweſt of all People) they inſenſibly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied into vaſt numbers under the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of ſlavery and tyrannical uſage; and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be no longer a ſtranger in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by what ſtupendious wonders did God deliver them? With what a ſtrong Hand, and a ſtretched-out Arm did he take them out of the Houſe of Bondage; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Anger of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Oppoſition of his Subjects? And when in the Wilderneſs they went from one Nation to another people, how did he preſerve them, that no man could do them wrong? And how did he reprove, even Kings for their ſake? One Miracle brought them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63922:133"/>Bread; a ſecond, Fleſh from Heaven; a third, Water out of the Flinty Rock, and their Cloaths were kept from wearing out, by the ſame extraordinary Power; an Angel was their Guide, and the Lord of Hoſts their King; with what terrible and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſounds was the Law given on the top of Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> With what Wiſdom, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and Authority was it explained by the Prophets? Who confirm'd it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ſigns and wonders, and foretold the Incarnation of the Son of God, who ſhould fulfil the Law, and all the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; and yet how obſtinate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, how untractable and ſullen, how ſtubborn and rebellious is this People? Deſpiſing the Divine Mercies, and denying the Lord who bought them, when he had condeſcended to cloath himſelf with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, to be born in their Country, of an <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Stock, and of the Seed of King <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Name was by them had in Everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
                        <p>What could God have done more to his Vineyard, that he ever left undone? He planted it in a fruitful ſoyl, in a Land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Milk and Honey; he water'd it with the Dew of Heaven, and cheer'd and warm'd it with the Beams of the Sun of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63922:134"/>Righteouſneſs, he fenc't and ſecured it by an extraordinary Providence, and the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of Angels (<hi>Michael</hi> the Prince of thoſe Bleſſed Spirits being deputed to the Tuition) he manured it by the Miniſtry of Kings and inſpired Men, and by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Husbandry of his own Darling, and with infinite Patience waited, till it would anſwer his Expectations, and pay him with a Vintage that might recompence his Coſt and his Labour; but inſtead of Grapes it brought forth Bryars and Thiſtles, it rewarded the pains of thoſe who cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, with nothing but fruitleſs labour, which not only filled them with melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reflections on their unſucceſsful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, but coſt many of them their Lives; ſo cruel and barbarous is ingratitude, that it never is at reſt, till it imbrues its Hands in the Blood of its beſt Friends and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors; ſo inhumane were the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo bent to the Deſtruction of thoſe whoſe ſole buſineſs it was to ſave them from Deſtruction. It was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue that was Gods Pleaſant Plant; the Hedg was the Divine Protection; the Winepreſs digg'd in it, was the Law which he gave them, written with his own Finger, and which continually urged them with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63922:134"/>of Obedience; the Tower which he erected was the Temple, the Beauty, and Honour, as well as the ſafety of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (for nothing but Religion, and the true Worſhip of God can make a people ſafe or happy, and when that is ſecured, all other things are beſtowed of courſe); the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen were the Governours of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Spiritual and Civil, who upon a juſt return of God's Portion to him, were to have a liberal ſhare of the Fruits for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and who could make a wiſer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion? Upon this the Lord ſeems to take a Journey into another Countrey, intruſting them with the managery; but leſt they ſhould forget, that they were not Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors but only Uſetructuaries, he frequently takes occaſion to ſend to them his Servants the Prophets, to mind them of their Truſt and their Obligations; but <hi>Michaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> they beat and impriſoned; <hi>Zechary</hi> ths Son of <hi>Jehciada</hi> they ſtoned, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> they ſawed aſunder, another <hi>Zechary</hi> they ſlew between the Temple and the Altar, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> was murdered at <hi>Babylon</hi> for reproving the Idolatry of the Governour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Amos</hi> was ſlain with a Sword, and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> beheaded; nay, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the men of God eſcap't their Malice?

He is not eaſily provok'd, nor does he delight in the Death of a ſinner, but trys all methods to reclaim and amend him; after ſo many meſſages that failed of ſucceſs, he reſolves to try the laſt Experiment; he had one only Son, the Darling of his Boſom, and him he deputes to this Embaſſy, believing that if their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice were not deſperate and incurable, they would reverence him who was the Heir to the Vineyard; but when <hi>Jeſus</hi> came into the World, a Preacher of the glad Tidings of Peace, all their malice that before vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf in parcels upon the Prophets, concenter'd and fixt in him, tho they knew him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father; now they join all their Forces, ſummon their Councils, unite their different Factions, and determine to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, and then the Inheritance would be their own; their Dignity, their Reven es, their Authority ſecured to themſelves and their Deſcendants for ever: But how emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inſignificant are the Councils of

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63922:136"/>that inſenſible Fabrick, but to view the beautiful Pile all in a flame, the Holy of Holies polluted, and the Blood of the Prieſts mingled with the Blood of their Sacrifices, this would force Tears from a Heart of Flint, as it raiſed a ſtrong compaſſion in the mind of their very Conqueror; and at the ſame time to ſee Mothers cramb their ravenous Stomachs with the Fleſh of their own Children, to ſee Brethren ſheath their Swords in one anothers Boſoms; nothing but Rapine and Sacriledg, Civil Diſſentions and Murders among men of the ſame Faith and Country, till the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my broke in upon them, and involved the ſeveral parties of a great and populous Nation in the ſame common deſolation: Theſe are Reflections that puzzle Belief, and create Aſtoniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Did ever any of thy words, O my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, fall to the Ground without Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment?

'Twas a denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the greateſt Veracity, as well as of the deepeſt Horror, That the preſent Generation ſhould not paſs away till all ſhould be fulfilled, and that even in ſimilar circumſtances: At the Paſſover they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and at the ſame time of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63922:136"/>the Year, (when all the people of <hi>Judea</hi> were come up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip) did the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies beleaguer the City.

VVho can diſobey his word, neglect to be better'd by his Sacraments, grieve his Spirit, and refuſe to be convinc'd by his Miracles, and hope to eſcape the Anger of God? With what greater reaſon then ſhouldſt thou tremble, O my ſoul, and be in a great Agony, when my conſcience is examined? My fears are not of the loſs of temporal priviledges, of being disfranchis'd, of loſing my Liberty, my Eſtate or my Life, but of being caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, and ruin'd for ever: The loſs of a worldly Kingdom is no way comparable to the loſs of the Kingdom of God; Crowns and Scepters are but Trifles when put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ballance with the Favour of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and how much more dreadful are the inflictions reſerved for thoſe who have been bleſt with greater priviledges, and yet have requited their Saviour with more groſs Offences, and more notorious Ingratitude? How ſhall they eſcape, who have neglected ſo great Salvation? And is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63922:137"/>it not a greater Crime to affront, deſpiſe, and reject a Saviour now he is glorified, than it was, when he was a man of ſorrow; and acquainted with Grief? And is it not an addition to the offence, to continue in the ways of diſobedience, when ſo many examples of God's indignation are viſible to the world, how ſharply he reſents the contempt of his long ſuffering? And am I not convinc'd, that the ſame Anger hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeized many Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that fell ſo heavy upon <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> In what a ſad and deplorable condition are the once famous Churches of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Africa?</hi> How is the once religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Aegypt</hi> overrun with <hi>Mahometaniſm?</hi> And where are the anciently venerable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of <hi>Aſia?</hi> If <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath fixt his Seat in the Temple of God, who can hear, and does not tremble? And what ſhould hinder, O my ſtubborn heart, but that thou ſhouldſt at laſt relent? Do not theſe Examples unriddle thy Doom? and can there be more mercy reſerv'd in ſtore for thee, than hath been ſhown to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were as much in Covenant with their Maker, and more juſtly intituled to his Tuition? If no Church dare preſume on its priviledges, no ſingle perſon ought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63922:138"/>to think himſelf ſecure of thy Favour, O my God, any longer than he obeys thy Commandments. Teach me therefore, O my Saviour, not to be high minded, but to fear, leſt if God ſpared not the natural Branches, he may be much leſs inclined to ſpare me, whoſe Title is worſe, and whoſe Enormities have been more notorious.</p>

For the thoughts of ſuch perſons being fixt on Heaven, they talk of the place, as if they were there already; their ſtile is more brisk and vigorous than ordinary, and their words make a deeper impreſſion; ſuch was our Saviours laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſuch the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, which they wrote in their bonds.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jeſus</hi> having diſcovered <hi>Judas,</hi> forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Peter,</hi> and bound the reſt of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to mutual Love and Charity; at length tells them, that it was the greateſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heighth of paſſion, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of reaſoning, to be troubled at the adverſities of this preſent life; that he who is ſtrong in Faith, is above the aſſault of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular dangers; and whoever is called to embrace the Goſpel, is out of the reach, and beyond the Fears of temporal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that when you impriſon him, you do not rob him of his Liberty; and when you kill him, you cannot hurt him; for he that depends on the Crucified Jeſus for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is ſecure, that if he ſuffer with his Maſter, he ſhall reign with him: Such a man is aſſured, that there is ſo large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for him in Heaven, that it baffles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63922:144"/>all carnal objections, and ſtifles the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe or remembrance of pain; for his Maſter is aſcended to his Father's Right Hand; not ſo much to glorifie his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to intercede for us, that we may be glorified; there he is now our Advocate, and from thence he ſhall come again at the laſt day to be our guide, that where he is, we may be forever with him; nor can any thing hinder our Union with him to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who have been united to him here in the Offices of Piety; our natural corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot obſtruct the Union, our Saviour is <hi>the way,</hi> nor can our ignorance do us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, he is <hi>the Truth;</hi> and the Attempts of death it ſelf are vain and of no force, he is <hi>the Life:</hi> For as long as the Father and he are one (and ſo they ſhall be to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity) all the Power and Wiſdom of the Godhead muſt dwell in him bodily, and who can reſiſt Omnipotence, or outwit the only Wiſe God? Eſpecially when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that his Goodneſs is commenſurate to his Power and his Wiſdom, ſo that the meaneſt of his Servants, when he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them, ſhall be able to do all things; and the greateſt of the Miracles that Chriſt himſelf did, ſhall be leſs than what his Followers ſhall be able to do; nor is it to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63922:144"/>be doubted how this can be; Since the Prayers of a good man, recommended in the Name, and upon the account of the Merits of his Saviour, anſwer all devout ends and purpoſes (and for this end proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the afflictions of this life were made the Portion of Chriſtianity, that if our Duty did not, our needs might bring us often on our Knees) for God denies nothing, where the love of the Supplicant is bright and ardent, and makes it ſelf illuſtrious in a life of Obedience; for upon ſuch a man the Holy Dove deſcends, and becomes his Comforter, his Companion and his Friend; it inſtructs him when ignorant, it relieves him if oppreſt, it encourages and defends him when timerous, it beſtows all that is good, and protects from all that is evil; this Spirit is the Vicar unto the Biſhop of Souls, it was primarily deſigned to lead the Church into all Truth, and to ſecure it from periſhing under the perſecutions of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to ſupply the want of the bodily Preſence of the Redeemer of Mankind; this Spirit was to unriddle all the Myſteries of Religion, and to reveal what was hid from the cognizance of Ages, to make thoſe on whom it ſhould deſcend, the darlings of God, and to give them Heaven upon Earth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63922:145"/>in the Enjoyment of Holy Thoughts and a quiet Mind, which none of the diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Life ſhall be able to ruffle or diſcompoſe.</p>
                        <p>When the Soul is fixt on this Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being put out of the Synagogue ſignifies nothing, nor can Death dreſt in its moſt formidable ſhape, create any terrors; for our Maſter hath told us, that as in the deepeſt of his ſufferings, the bleſt Angels miniſtred unto him; ſo they ſhall to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient followers; and that their reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall ſucceed his; for the greateſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of mutual love are beneath the indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are berween Jeſus and a good man: the Branches are not ſo firmly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vine, as the devout Soul is to its Saviour; it is a Member of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as dear to him as his own Honour: This Union, neither diſtance of Place, nor alteration of Circumſtances can diſſolve: 'tis a Union cemented by the Blood of God, and is built on a Foundation that ſtands moſt ſure, it is built upon God's Knowledg who are his, and upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants departing from all iniquity: but it is a Union that is better felt than deſcribed; and no one knows the happineſs of it, but he who hath experimented it: As long as this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63922:145"/>Friendſhip laſts, the Chriſtian is impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do every thing that may glorifie his Maſter, and benefit himſelf; and what himſelf cannot do by his own Abilities, ſhall be ſupplied by the Intereſts of his Saviour, and procured by his own intenſe Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if any man wilfully diſſolve this Concord, like a Branch cut off from the ſtock, he withers and dies, and becomes fit for nothing, but to be caſt into Eternal Flames: Now nothing can break this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Vice and Iniquity; for that which makes the Holy Jeſus the only Beloved of his Father, is his Obedience to the Divine Laws, and his Paſſionate love to the world, that engaged him to dye for it; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loves God and his Neighbour ſhall be made Partaker of all his Favour, and his Heart ſhall be filled with Joy; and can there be a more cogent Argument than this to endear Religion to a well inclined mind? To be made the Friends of God, the Elect and Beloved of the Saviour of the World, the Pupils of the Spirit of Truth and Peace; to have one Comforter to redeem them, and another to ſanctifie them; and to have the Honour of being God's Ambaſſadors, and the Witneſſes of Religion to an Infidel, Debauch't, and Superſtitious World; for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63922:146"/>let Men and Devils combine againſt ſuch Perſons, and exert all their Strength and Cunning to ruin them; they ſuffer no more than what their Maſter hath done already; nor can they periſh, becauſe they are under the Shadow and Protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                        <p>Not but that Chriſtianity, like the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, is and always will be attended with Oppoſition, and the contrivances of the Kingdom of Darkneſs to ruin it; but that man does not deſerve the Priviledges of the Kingdom of God, that cannot be a Martyr for it, that cannot patiently ſuffer an unjuſt Excommunication from the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and from Life it ſelf, that he may follow his Saviour. It is true, the Doctrine of the Croſs is uncouth and uneaſie, and Men naturally are unwilling to court Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and Tortures, eſpecially when their Bigotted Enemies ſhall by their uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cenſures, as much as lies in them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Souls, as well as their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and their Lives, by pretending the Advancement of Religion, and God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when they murder the Profeſſors of the beſt Religion that ever was or ſhall be in the World: But theſe are the Terms of the Goſpel Covenant, and this is owning
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63922:146"/>our Maſter; (for tho a Man may formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call Chriſt Lord, and yet be ſhut out of his Kingdom, yet no man can ſay ſo effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by the Holy Ghoſt); and he who will not embrace the Hardſhips, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Advantages of this Religion: Nor is this ſo diſconſolate an Eſtate as Men imagine; for beſides that it is better to be afflicted here, than to be damn'd for ever, that man cannot be miſerable whom the Holy Ghoſt comforts; and tho in the World he ſhall unavoidably meet with Tribulation, yet he ought to be of good Chear, becauſe he hath Peace in his Saviour, who hath by his Death and Reſurrection o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the World, and emancipated the Sons of God from a ſtate of Slavery, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate them into the Glorious Liberty of the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>There was no need that the Son of God ſhould have promis'd theſe Conſolations to his Apoſtles, while himſelf was with them; his own Preſence was a ſufficient Bleſſing, great enough to ſupply all their wants; but this was a Felicity that they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to enjoy, it being requiſite that he ſhould depart to make way for the deſcent of the Comforter; who when he ſhould come into the World, ſhould direct the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63922:147"/>in the diſcharge of their duty, giving them an intire Account of the Nature, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and Extent of their Maſters King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and inſtruct them in all other things, which during their Maſters Life time their ſhallow Underſtandings were capable of comprehending; and who alſo ſhould ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly convince all their Enemies, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Pride and Confidence, they were in a ſtate of ſin, particularly guilty of Unbelief, and that nothing but Faith in a Saviour could render them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; that all their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether by the guidance of the Law, or by the ſtrength of Nature, was inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant and of no value; and that nothing could reconcile the World but the Death of Chriſt: but if this Holy Spirit could not perſwade men, it ſhould at laſt aſſure them that they ſhall be judg'd for their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for Satan is already condemned, and ſo ſhall all his Followers be.</p>
                        <p>This Spirit our Compaſſionate Saviour engaged to beſtow on his Apoſtles; and as his Performances always out-do even his own Promiſes; ſo he filled them with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, and the other Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, till they by the incredible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſuffering and dying, overcame all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63922:147"/>Prejudices, and triumpht in the Conqueſt of the World: And ſo ſhall all the other Servants of God, who ſincerely take Jeſus for their Maſter, tho they may not be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Holy Ghoſt to cure the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſeaſed, or to raiſe the dead; tho they cannot allay Tempeſts, or caſt out Devils, yet their Triumphs ſhall be as great, tho of another Nature; the Bleſſed Spirit ſhall impower them to mortifie their Luſts, to reſiſt Temptations, and to raiſe a Soul, dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, to a ſtate of new Life, and holy Performances; and this in Truth is a nobler Honour, and a more beneficial enjoyment, than Ability to work Wonders; for many that have called others from their Grave, have themſelves dropt into Hell: But he that hath renounc'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and deſpiſed ſenſualities, ſhall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enter into unſpeakable Joys: And now what hinders, but that I alſo ſhould be my Redeemer's Diſciple, and partake of his Grace? Why ſhould any of thy Creatures, O my God, love thee better than I? Why ſhould any of thy Servants, tho Prophets, Apoſtles, or Martyrs, be more conformable to thy Laws than I? Haſt thou done more for them than me? Didſt thou not dye for me alſo? And haſt thou not given me thy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63922:148"/>Goſpel, thy Blood, thy Sacraments, and the Aſſiſtance of thy Spirit? Nay, haſt thou not done more for me in forgiving me more and greater ſins, than ever they committed? And where there is much forgiven, ſhould there not alſo be a proportionable Degree of Love? I will therefore hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to theſe paſſionate Words of my dying Saviour, and I will remember they are his laſt Will and Teſtament; and as I hope to enjoy the Legacies that he hath left me of inward Peace and Heavenly Bliſs, ſo I will comply with his Deſires, and perform all that he enjoyns me; and ſo, tho I here come behind the Apoſtles in Age, in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, in Zeal, and Holineſs, yet I ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them at the Day of the Retribution of all Things, when I ſhall be enabled to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all Myſteries, and to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, and ſhall ſhare in the Crowns and Scepters that ſhall be the largeſſes of that happy time, which ſhall end in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                        <p>To the Mountain our Bleſſed Maſter retired when he offered his Sacrifices of Suplications and Praiſe; from a Mountain did he preach the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, and on a Mountain was he Transſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured: there he prayed, not that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hill is nearer to Heaven than the deepeſt Valley, not that God hears a Suppliant ſooner from a place of Eminence, but becauſe there he was moſt ſequeſtred from the World, free from noiſe and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and in the fitteſt place to converſe with God: From a Mountain he preached, not that he coveted the higheſt ſeat in that ſpacious ſynagogue, but that he might be the more eaſily heard by his Auditory, and that the New Law might be preached from as eminent a Pulpit as the Old: and to the Mountain he retires to manifeſt his Glory, not ſo much to tell his Diſciples, that he who will be made Partaker of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Honour, muſt leave this lower world, as to conceal the Miracle to avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63922:153"/>of vain glory, and the defires of ſecular applauſe: On Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> was <hi>Jeſus</hi> Crucified in the View of all the world, but he was Transfigured on <hi>Mount Tabor,</hi> in the view of only Three of his Diſciples: Thus every Action of our Maſters is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in its ſeaſon, he had juſt before ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Diſciples with an Account of his own ſufferings, and the neceſſity that they alſo muſt drink of the ſame bitter Potion; and that he who does not take up his Croſs and follow his Saviour, is not worthy to enter into the Kingdom of God: but leſt this Diſcourſe might diſhearten them, a few days after he carries the moſt eminent of his Domeſticks with him to the Holy Mountain, there to confirm their Faith, and ſtrengthen their Reſolutions, by aſſuring them that he who hath once had a view of the Recompence of Reward, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be affrighted at the ſight of the Croſs; to ſee his afflicted Condition; and to hear from his own Mouth, whoſe every Word was Oracle, that his ſtate for the Future ſhould be more uneaſie and deplorable, was a ſad ſuggeſton: For how can this be? That he ſhould ſave others who could not ſave himſelf? That he ſhould protect his Followers, who could not reſcue himſelf
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63922:153"/>from the ſhame and the torture of his ſcourging, and his Crucifixion: But to ſee his Face ſhine like the Sun in its Glory, and his Garments made whiter than Alabaſter, and more glittering than Gold, this was an irreſiſtable Conviction, that the light Afflictions that are but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
                        <p>It was fit that this extraordinary Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhould be kept ſecret for a while, and therefore a place of retirement was the moſt proper Scene for this Act; but it was requiſite that ſome Perſons ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to atteſt the Miracle, and thoſe no leſs than Three, that according to the Law, in the Mouth of Two or Three Witneſſes the Truth might be eſtabliſh'd, when in due time the World ſhould be acquainted with it: As therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> left the Elders and the People at the bottom of <hi>Sinai,</hi> and took <hi>Aaron, Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> with him, when he went up to ſpeak with God; ſo did Chriſt leave the Multitude, and the Nine behind him, and took <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with him to ſee and hear the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Transfiguration.</p>
                        <p>And why (if I may preſume to ask my unerring Redeemer why) theſe Three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63922:154"/>the reſt of the Apoſtles? Was not <hi>Andrew</hi> the firſt Convert, and the Elder Brother to <hi>Simon?</hi> And was not <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Alphaeus</hi> as much an Apoſtle as <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee?</hi> And was not <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Zelot</hi> as earneſt an Aſſerter of his Maſters Honour as the Beloved Diſciple? I muſt confeſs it does not become humane ignorance to pretend to dive into the ſecrets of the Divine Wiſdom; and yet perhaps we are allowed to conjecture where we cannot be certain: Theſe Three Diſciples were our Saviours Darlings and his Companions in all extraordinary Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; when <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Dead, they only were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Spectators; and when <hi>Jeſus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went his bitter Agony in the Garden, they attended him to the Theatre of Sorrows and Sufferings; and to them he gave pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar additional Names, which Honour he did not vouchſafe to the reſt of the Twelve: <hi>Simon</hi> he ſirnamed <hi>Peter,</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> he called <hi>Boanerges,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sons of Thunder:</hi> It was fit to be revealed to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who was choſen to a Primacy of Order in the Colledg of the Apoſtles; to <hi>James,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt of all that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Family of our Lord, who was to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63922:154"/>Crown'd with Martyrdom; and to <hi>John,</hi> not only becauſe he was the Beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and dyed a Virgin, but alſo becauſe he was deſigned to live longeſt of all the Twelve, that he might own and atteſt the Miracle after the other Apoſtles were laid in their Graves, when the early Hereticks ſhould deny the Divinity of our Lord.</p>
                        <p>In the view of theſe Perſons was <hi>Jeſus</hi> Transfigured; not that the Nature and Subſtance of his Body was changed, but his Appearance, his Head was ſurrounded with Rays, and his whole Body inlightened with the Beams of his Divinity; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Glory was greater and more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous than that either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elias:</hi> But it is to be remembred, that theſe bright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens did not ſignalize him as ſoon as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the Hill; but after he had retired himſelf and prayed; for every happineſs of another Life is a Recompence of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this; and could it have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the Apoſtles ſhould be drowſie, while their Maſter watch'd unto Prayer? That they ſhould fall aſleep while they were about to enjoy that ſight that only was worth ſeeing on this ſide Heaven? but ſo eaſily are we inclined to grow lazy and idle, to indulge to ſloth and ſenſuality, when
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63922:155"/>the beſt example and the beſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments incite us to Devotion; for thus the ſame men did, when their Maſter was in his Agony, tho they had juſt before received the venerable Sacrament, and knew their Maſter was that Night to be betrayed; ſuch is our humane Frailty, and ſo violent are our Inclinations to forget our Duty; tho perhaps this ſleep was rather an Extaſie, the brightneſs of the Apparition dazling the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſurprizing the Soul, which in all Prophetick Viſions being unable to ſuſtain the Revelation, is aſtoniſh'd at the fight, and ſinks under the Weight of it, as the Eyes are too weak to gaze on the Sun; and this my Charity for thoſe Reverend men would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline me to believe: But whatever the ſleep was, as ſoon as ever the Apoſtles did awake, (as if it had been a juſt Puniſhment for their ſloth and negligence) the bleſt Society broke up, and the Holy Men retired; whom the Apoſtles knew to be what they were, not ſo much by their Diſcourſe (for during that Entercourſe they were a ſleep) as by their Maſters Condeſcention, who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Notice to them by a Method beſt known to himſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> doubtleſs came in their own bodies, they were not repreſented by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63922:155"/>Phantaſms, or the intervention of Angels; for it was requiſite, that as our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour took upon him our humane Nature in Truth and Reality, and not in Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſo his Humiliation ſhould be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by imaginary, but by real Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: <hi>Moſes</hi> came from his unknown Grave, and <hi>Elias</hi> from the place whither his fiery Chariot had driven him, to accompany <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> on the Holy Mount, whence probably they went into Paradiſe together. <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Lawgiver, and <hi>Elias</hi> the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Prophets; the one a Man of the meekeſt Temper, the other a Man of the warmeſt Zeal; to aſſure the World, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was he of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ſpake, the Lamb of God, and the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elias</hi> nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any other of the Ancient Wondrous Men were deputed to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but only the Lord of Glory, the Prince of the World, and that he came not to deſtroy the Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave, and <hi>Elias</hi> vindicated, but to fulfil it. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were preſent with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> two of his moſt immediate Repreſentatives, with the great Redeemer, both wrought ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Miracles, both faſted forty days and nights, and both convers'd with God in the Mount in the days of their Fleſh.</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:63922:156"/>
                        <p>Nor canſt thou, O my Soul, imagine that theſe great Perſons had this interview without ſome Converſation; and it is very remarkable, that they diſcours'd, not of the ineffable Union of the Holy Trinity, nor of the Orders of the Holy Angels; they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd not of the Songs of the Saints, nor of the Employment of the Seraphim, of the hidden Decrees, or the Laws of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but of the Sufferings of <hi>Jeſus</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of that very Article of the Chriſtian Faith, at which the Apoſtles were ſo ſtartled: The Holy Redeemer of the World had reſolved to carry the Marks of his ſufferings with him, his Scars and his Wounds, when he aſcended into Heaven, and therefore it could not be abſurd for thoſe who dwelt there to diſcourſe of them, for they alſo were Partakers of the Benefits of his Crucifixion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peter</hi> as ſoon as he did awake, being all heat, had preſently forgot the place of his Nativity and of his Reſidence; no longer did he think upon his Wife and Family, his Trade and Intereſts, the Mountain with ſuch Company was preſerable to all the World in his Opinion; and he thought it better to be there than in the Palace of Princes; and becauſe he imagin'd that that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63922:156"/>Holy Society could not ſubſiſt without ſome accomodations, he was for having Three Tabernacles built there, as if glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodies needed earthly Conveniences: But his Devotion made Compenſation for his Ignorance, and his Maſter conſtrued it as it was, a well-meant miſtake; tho what the Apoſtle wiſht, the Piety of ſucceeding Ages perform'd: The devout Mother of the Great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> St. <hi>Helena,</hi> built on that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a beautiful Temple, to which were added Two Monaſteries, and ſo the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles were erected, tho not for the uſe of the Perſons that were concern'd in the Transfiguration, for they needed them not, but for the benefit of thoſe who were to imitate the meekneſs and humility of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the mortifications and zeal of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Patience and Obedience of the Holy <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And this Piety was a greater Honour to the Church, than all that the Apoſtle could project could have been to himſelf, or that Triumvirate of bleſſed Perſons; for irregular and miſguided zeal commonly loſes its reward, as it happened to the Apoſtle, for immediately upon this Propoſal, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> retired to their proper ſtations, and left our Holy Saviour alone: And this alſo had its juſt reaſon; for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63922:157"/>preſently thereupon came a Voice from Heaven to confirm the Apoſtles in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their Maſter, telling them that he was the beloved of God, and that they ought to hear and to obey him. Now had not the Prophets retired, there might have been ſome ground for miſtake; but when <hi>Jeſus</hi> was alone, the voice out of the Cloud could never deceive them: This was the moſt ſenſible and publick demonſtration that a Company of men were capable of; and thus begun our Redeemers Glorification on Earth. This Tranſaction was for a while concealed even from our Maſters bleſſed Mother and his brethren; (to aſſure us, that it would have been of no advantage to the Holy Virgin to have born him, had ſhe not believed in him; nor to his Kindred to be allyed to him, had they not been his Diſciples; becauſe it is Grace, not Nature that makes a Chriſtian): but now that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is conferr'd on all mankind, on us of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, that were without God, and without hope, that we might be no longer ſtrangers &amp; forreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God. God forbid therefore, that I ſhould deſire to know any thing but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and him Crucified; it is the Theme of Angels
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63922:157"/>and Glorified Saints; and how can I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt ſuch a Saviour, who in his deepeſt Humiliation was crown'd with ſo much Honour? This Conſideration ſtrengthens my Faith, and ſecures my hope of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life: For why ſhould I deſpair, while my Saviour is my Friend, and hath promis'd to be ſo, till I renounce and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him? and what ſhould incline me to be ſo brutiſh, ſince without him every thing is miſerable, and in his Company under his Influences, a Wilderneſs is as the Garden of God? And how ſhould I long for his Company in Heaven; for if while he was here on Earth, the Place where he reſided was from his occaſional reſidence called Holy, as <hi>Tabor</hi> is called the Holy Mount; what preference ought I to give in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, my Eſteem, my Love, to the place of his fixt reſidence? To ſee him at his Fathers Right Hand, is a ſight would engage a man to be a Martyr to enjoy it; there are <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and all the goodly Fellowſhip of the Prophets; there are <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and all the Glorious Company of the Apoſtles; there is the Noble Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Martyrs and Confeſſors; and what ſhould hinder, but that I a poor Sinner may make one of that bleſſed Society, and ſing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63922:158"/>the Praiſes of my Saviour with them to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?</p>

                        <p>THE Condition of Mankind in this Life is relative, and made up of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies upon Heaven; nor could <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt Eſtate ſubſiſt without the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his Maker; Communion with God is the End of Religion, and was the Employment of Paradiſe: nor can any thing elſe make the World happy: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God who is a pure Spirit, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men without condeſcending to treat us according to our Capacities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Truth, when it viſits us, is content to be dreſt in our Habits; when God ſpeaks to us, he entertains us not with his own Loſty and Majeſtick Expreſſions, but with modes of Speech, and Repreſentations of Things, that we are acquainted with. It is true, had we been made without Fleſh and Blood, our Graces had come to us like themſelves, not wrapt up in Emblems and Figures; but becauſe we cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63922:165"/>our ſenſes, and are moſt affected with what we hear and ſee, thereſore God ſpeaks to our outward man in viſible miniſtrations, the Almighty Wiſdom treating the World with ſenſible Objects, the better to lead them to the Contemplation of thoſe things that are inviſible; and this was the cauſe why Rites and Ceremonies were inſtituted in the Church, as marks of Communion, and incentives of Devotion. Angels, we know, who are not clogg'd with a load of Fleſh and Blood, and whoſe dwelling is above, have no need of Sacraments: they who have the Honour of a clear Viſion of the Almighty, and the freedom of a more immediate Converſe with him, need not theſe remoter Encouragements to Piety (and ſuch alſo ſhall be the Happineſs of God's Servants after they dye) but man in his beſt and moſt innocent Eſtate want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and therefore God planted, and by a particular ſanction conſtituted the two Trees in <hi>Eden</hi> to be two Sacraments, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible ſings of the Favour which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould partake of, if he perform'd the conditions of obedience which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from him, they repreſenting to him the ſtate of Wiſdom and Felicity, which was reſerved for him in Heaven, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63922:165"/>to inform him, that to attempt the knowledg of the higheſt Myſteries to the prejudice of the Divine Commands, is not the way to Life and Immortality.</p>
                        <p>To maintain this Union with God, <hi>Adam</hi> was endued with Original Righteouſneſs, he had no Appetites to mortifie, no Luſts to conquer, no Doubts to be reſolved: his Underſtanding was clear, and his Will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; and there was need of nothing but an external Law to guide him, and the two Trees to be his inſtructors: And when Paradiſe was loſt, <hi>Adam</hi> and his followers ſtill retain'd their peculiar Ceremonies; they had their ſet places, and times of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, and the eldeſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was deputed to the Prieſthood; till the generality of Mankind corrupting themſelves, the Divine Vengeance ſwept them away, drowning the Old World, and ſealing a Covenant of Mercy with the New, ratified by the Sacramental Sign of the Rainbow, that God would no more bring a Deluge on the Earth. Out of this new Race of Men did God ſelect the <hi>Jews;</hi> among whom he was reſolved more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly, and in an extraordinary manner to fix his dwelling, the Divine Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding over the Mercy-Seat. This Seed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63922:166"/>of <hi>Jacob</hi> he ſingled out to be a Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mark'd them as his own People by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which was a Character of Genealogical Sanctity; and having united them into one numerous brotherhood, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> which was a publick Foederal Rite of their Union with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: And to this purpoſe he required them to furniſh him continually with a Table, whereon ſhould be Bread, and Salt, and the Fleſh of the Morning and Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, with the Drink-Offerings, which they were obliged to tender him: Not that God did either need, or actually devour theſe Oblations, or lived on the ſteam of the Blood, or the ſouls of ſlain beaſts, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> imagined; nor that hereby a contrivance might be made for the eaſier maintenance of his Prieſts (this was the cuſtom of the Temple of <hi>Baal</hi>) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe eating and drinking together, was look'd on as a Confirmation of Friendſhip, and one of the ſtrongeſt engagements to love and kindneſs, as to treſpaſs the Laws of Hoſpitality, to eat of a Man's bread, and then to lift up his Heel againſt him, was accounted the Character of a moſt profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and vile perſon.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>And it is very obſervable, that tho our great Maſter came into the world to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new Religion, and in purſuance of that deſign, to aboliſh all the typical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, yet he was pleaſed to adopt almoſt all the other Rites of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to make them free of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church; thus he choſe to complete his moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prayer out of the uſual forms of the Synagogue: and as he eſtabliſht the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juriſdiction which he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, according to the different Orders
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63922:167"/>of the Prieſthood: So eſpecially he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that as they Baptized their proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, ſo all that were admitted into the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that he purchaſed with his Blood, ſhould be waſhed in the Laver of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and as after the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Lamb was eaten, the Maſter of the Family took Bread into his hands, and lifting it up from the Table, that all who were in the Houſe, might ſee it, bleſſed it by calling upon the name of the Lord; and when that was diſtributed, took the Cup in like manner: ſo did our bleſſed Saviour. And whereas the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters did not only allow the people when they did eat the Paſſover, to mix, and dilute their rich and generous Wines, thereby to correct the ſtrength and heat of them,

                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63922:167"/>and to correct the ſcrupulous ſqueemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome of his followers, who, he knew, would take unjuſt offence at the conforming the Eccleſiaſtical ceremonies to forreign obſervances.</p>
                        <p>This was the inſtitution of this tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous myſtery; nor was it only a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary inſtitution; for our Saviour being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that his Diſciples ſhould always carry about with them the marks of his love, and always have in remembrance the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his crucifixion, not only gave this Sacrament to his Apoſtles, but enjoyned them himſelf to take Bread, to bleſs it, break it, and diſtribute it, as their Maſter did, to the worlds end; and obliged alſo the Laity by the mouth of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to take, eat and drink the Body and Blood of their Saviour until his ſecond coming; for as often as they did it, the whole action was a remembrance of the dying <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his ſufferings for an undone world, and of his ſacrificing himſelf to the Divine juſtice. The firſt Sacrifice that our bleſſed Maſter made, was the Euchariſt, but that was but a type of what was to be done the next day, when himſelf was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the Croſs on a new and unheard of Altar. And there ought to have been an
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63922:168"/>Altar erected, ſuch as the world never knew of, becauſe the Sacrifice was ſuch as was never before heard of; for himſelf was the Sacrifice and the Prieſt too. He was not therefore to be offered at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but without the Gates, becauſe to be number'd among the Tranſgreſſors; and the Altar was erected on high, that he might purge the Air, and drive the Prince of it thence; and that his Blood ſtreaming from him to the Ground, might waſh and cleanſe the Earth alſo, polluted with the ſins of its inhabitants: Had this Sacrifice been offered at the Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> might have pretended a ſole claim to it: but it was offered without the City, that all the world might partake of its benefits. This was the primary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to which we owe our Peace, and our hopes of Salvation: and this Sacrifice is again ſlain and offered, when the Holy Man ſtands at the Lords Table; for the Euchariſt is not only an Emblem of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual refreſhments (how much the ſoul is nouriſh'd by Grace and good reſolves) nor is it only a repreſentation of the joys of Heaven (when we ſhall feaſt on the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Supper of the Lamb), but it is truly a Feaſt, in which we make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63922:168"/>with God by Sacrifice: it is a Feaſt upon that Sacrifice, and that a Sacrifice for ſin, a Sacrifice which our Redeemer once offered to cleanſe the world from their ſins, and we offer as often as we commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, ſetting that Immaculate Lamb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eyes of God, and by that intreating him to have Mercy upon us: For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commanded us to do, as he did at the Inſtitution, in remembrance of him; not only to our ſelves and our Neighbours, but to God alſo, as the Ancients, and the moſt judicious of the Modern Writers affirm: For tho my Saviour was many Hundred Years ſince Crucified yet he is the Sacrament repreſented, as if his Paſſion commenc'd at the ſame time in which the Holy Office is performed; and what ſhould hinder my receiving the benefits of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, tho ſo long ſince undergone? For if by reaſon of my ſhare in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, notwithſtanding the vaſt diſtance of Time and Place, I and every one that is born is infected with Original Sin; what ſhould hinder, but that the Crucifixion of my Saviour, tho tranſacted ſo many Ages paſt, and in a Countrey ſo remote as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> ſhould be available to my Salvation? For as by one mans ſin, many were made
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63922:169"/>Offenders, ſo by the Obedience of one, many are made Righteous. The Prieſt therefore offers a Sacrifice at Gods Altar, a commemoration of that one, full, perfect and intire Sacrifice, which was once offered on the Croſs: And at the ſame time <hi>Jeſus</hi> our High Prieſt offers in Heaven, pleads his VVounds, and the merits of his Death, and implores the Divine Pardon, and the aſſiſtances of Grace for all his Servants.</p>
                        <p>And this is as much as the Church can pretend to, while it is Militant: ſo under the Old Law, the Prieſts who had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the Temple, were denied en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> thither only the High Prieſt went once a Year: but they were not denied the Liberty to direct the ſmoak of their incenſe toward that ſacred Place: and their Prayers and their Incenſe had acceſs where themſelves could not come: And ſo is it in the Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregration; for when the Oblation is made, we that are concern'd in the Offertory, cannot reach Heaven, while we are in this ſtate of Imperfection, but our High Prieſt is there already, and gives his People li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty thither to addreſs their ſupplications, and the ſweet Odours of their Devotion: this is the Honour, and theſe the Priviledges
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63922:169"/>that are purchaſed for the Church by that Sacrifice, and ſecured to it in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Bleſſed Euchariſt! Glorious things are ſpoken of it in the Writings of the good men of old; It is called the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Bread, the Divine Myſteries, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Sacrifices, the Honourable, the Holy, the Heavenly, the unſpeakable Gifts, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Sacraments, the Holy of Holies, the food which gives Life and Salvation, the nouriſhment which endears a man to his God, which recovers thoſe that languiſh, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals thoſe who are in error, which raiſes them that are fallen, and ſecures to the dying peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the rights of Immortality;</hi> and by way of eminency it is called <hi>the Sacrament; the bleſſed and holy Sacrament; when we eat of it, we feed on the fatneſs of the Lord's Body; and when we drink of it, we taſte the immortal Blood of our dying Saviour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If <hi>Manna</hi> were Angels food, this is the Bread of God; and what an honour is it to receive my Saviour? If <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Tomb, tho but a little and narrow place, when it entertain'd the Body of our crucified Lord, was by that means made more venerable and auguſt than the Palace of Kings; and became more glorious by containing the Son of God, than by being the reſidence
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63922:170"/>of the Angels, who there took up their ſtation; how much more excellent is my injoyment, when I give my dear Saviour a lodging in my heart, and my boſom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an habitation for the Lord of Life? With trembling therefore will I approach the Altar of God, I will admire the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and contemplate the circumſtances of his Paſſion (in which every word that he ſpoke was a Sermon, for his Croſs was his Pulpit, and Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> the Houſe of Prayer; for there he prayed for his enemies, and from thence he preached patience and ſubmiſſion to his Friends) and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his laſt actions; for tho in all his diſcourſes he ſpake ſo as never Man ſpake like him; yet he never entertain'd the world with ſo eloquent and convincing a Sermon, as when he went dumb before his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and opened not his mouth; when he carried his Croſs ſilently, and bore the marks of his adverſaries cruelty without murmuring: I will remember this my greateſt and beſt Friend; I will remember his laſt words and dying injunctions, and I will communicate with him in the benefits of his Paſſion till his ſecond appearance to judgment, when the juſt ſhall eat of the Tree of Life in a better Paradiſe; at that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63922:170"/>time all Signs ſhall ceaſe, all diſtant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of converſation ſhall expire; for in Heaven there are no Sacraments; ſo that at the dawning of the day, which the Lord himſelf ſhall enlighten, when no other beams ſhall be needful but thoſe of the Sun of Righteouſneſs to make it glorious for ever, then all Types and ſymbolical em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems ſhall be accompliſht, then I ſhall be united to my <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and perſonally enjoy that immediate communion, of which theſe Myſteries are but ſhadows and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote repreſentations.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63922:172"/>it was the day on which the World recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that was good, all that God could beſtow, or the World want, in a dying Saviour, who by his once offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, put an end to the numerous, diverſe and ineffectual Sacrifices required by the old Law.

And ſuch was the holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all his atchievements; for nothing leſs than unſpotted Innocence and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63922:193"/>conjoin'd, could furniſh the World with a Saviour. The whole Life of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a miracle of Love and Compaſſion, and the attempts of the Patriarchs appear mean and inconſiderable, when compared with the tranſcendent performances of the Son of God; for if to conſult the wants of mankind, and to relieve them; if curing their Bodies, and inſtructing their Souls; if feeding them with temporal food, and giving them the Bread of Heaven be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of a large and a divine Soul, then that title is peculiarly to be aſcribed to the Redeemer of the world, whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were one continued ſeries of benefits and mercies. I will therefore love the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of good men, but I will admire and adore <hi>Jeſus;</hi> I will make reflections on their excellent lives; but I muſt fix my thoughts on the converſation of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who, when he requires my adverting to his Pattern and his Laws, enjoins me to look off from all other objects, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle my eyes on him who loved me, and bought me with his own moſt precious blood; for they are but a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Sun of Righteouſneſs; and as when the Sun ariſes, the little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Clouds, and dusky vapours dwindle
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63922:194"/>and vaniſh; ſo when the glorious God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in competition, he eclipſes all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perfections: For that which ſuſtained the great Apoſtle when he was ready to be poured out as a drink-offering for the truth of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.</note> and what excited other Divine Men to ſuch extraordinary undertakings, was nothing but the remembrance of the Great Captain of our Salvation, who led the Van of the Noble Army of Martyrs; together with the powers of that Grace which he endowed them with, and the Crown that he held out to them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. What could diſcourage or affright thoſe who ſaw the Son of God engaged by no neceſſity, but acted only by his diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted love, ſo freely to undertake, ſubmit to, and glory in the Croſs and the Purple-robe, in the Gall and the Vinegar, in the Scoffs and Crown of Thorns, and at laſt make a triumphant Stage of his Croſs? Who can forbear dying for ſuch a Saviour, who ſo freely lay'd down his life for us? The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proſpect of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come, inflamed the Patriarchs, gave them life, and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with vigour <hi>to ſubdue Kingdoms, to work Righteouſneſs, to ſtop the mouths of Lyons, to quench the violence of the Fire, to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63922:194"/>eſcape the edge of the Sword; when tortured, not to accept of deliverance; to be content to be Stoned, to be Sawn aſunder, to be ſlain with the Sword, to wander about in Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented, that they might obtain a better reſurrection in him, who is the firſt fruits from the dead.</hi> And ſo did their Succeſſors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves, who ſaw Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd him come in the fleſh; they willingly choſe to <hi>hunger and thirſt, to be naked, and buffeted, and to have no certain dwelling place; to be perſecuted, defamed, and accounted the off-ſcowring of the World;</hi> in fine, to be made like their Maſter, a Spectacle to the World, to Angels, and to Men.</p>
                        <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> theſe are patterns of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and love to God that I am amazed at, and am afraid I want courage to imitate; but, Lord, by the help of thy Grace I will endeavour to make my zeal as ardent and as acceptable as theirs; and whereas thou haſt hitherto given me my lot in thy Church at ſuch a time, when Peace is an attendant on Religion (and may God of his Mercy long continue it) I will be a Martyr in that way, which thou art better pleaſed with (becauſe I may give my body to be burnt, and not be a Martyr) I will make an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63922:195"/>to thee of my ſelf, I will ſacrifice my paſſions, and mortify my members that are on the earth, and will lay aſide every weight, and the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet me, that I may run with patience the race that is ſet before me. (For when I crucify the old Man, and abandon the paths of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, then only am I truly to be ſaid to follow <hi>Jeſus</hi>) And if providence think fit ſo to order it, and my bleſſed Saviour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me, I will dye for his intereſts, and ſeal my vows with my blood; for what ſhould hinder but that I ſhould exert the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that was the glory of the Primitive Ages?

Their zeal and patience, their chearfulneſs and contempt of the World, their fortitude and conſtancy made it appear, that they put an eſtimate on nothing but the Service of God, and the concerns of Eternity; and why ſhould not I, as they did, look ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> for he is the author and finiſher of our Faith, the ſole inſtitutor of our Religion, who for the joy that ſhould accrue to him in the redemption of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined World from Sin, and Death, and Hell, in the glorification of his Body, and the

There is a warm conflict between my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to redeem the World, and my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities: between my love to men, and my natural deſires of ſelf-prefervation. And why (if a poor deſpicable ſinner may expoſtulate with his Maker) why theſe ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a few days before thy apprehenſion? Was not thy whole Life one continued act of Martyrdom? Was not the Tragedy
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63922:196"/>begun at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> tho the laſt ſcene was acted on Mount <hi>Calvary?</hi> Was not this bloody Baptiſm adminiſtred to thee in thy Infancy; and did not thy Crucifixion begin in thy Cradle? was not thy Circumciſion the morning-ſacrifice? and was not the completory oblation made in that diſmal evening in which thou wert Crucified? for tho thou wenteſt not into thy Grave till about the Thirty fourth year of thy Age, yet thou didſt dye dayly, and thine ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were commenſurate to thy Life; they begun the firſt hour thou ſaweſt the light in the Stable, and they laſted to the moment in which thou gaveſt up the ghoſt at <hi>Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi> every day was a <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> a day of ſorrow and ſufferings. Only herein lies the difference, under all his antecedent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the Life of the Son of God was ſtill preſerved, but at his apprehenſion that alſo was to be ſacrificed, and he who was only ſprinkled with blood at his Circumciſion, was now to be truly baptized and drench'd in it on his Croſs: but this <hi>Croſs he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and the appendent <hi>ſhame he deſpiſed;</hi> under which terms are included all his ſufferings, the torment and the ignominy of his exinanition.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63922:198"/>Garden, to his yielding up the ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſix whole hours he was hanging on the Croſs; and then he died while his Spirit was whole within him; (and while being in the vigour of his youth, his heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him was like melting wax) for in the heighth of all his acute pains he cried with a loud voice, and yielded up the ghoſt: his Body being more ſenſible of pain than uſually malefactors are; for he had a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſhape, and was of a fine and pure make, and of a delicate conſtitution, born of a Virgin, not ſubject to, and ſo never harraſt with diſeaſes; and the pains of his Soul bore proportion to his bodily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for he well knew how grievous and inſupportable the anger of God is, which we are inſenſible of; he dreaded the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of thoſe ſins which we delight in, and the ſeverity of thoſe puniſhments which we deride; his notions of things were clear, his apprehenſion quick, and the bent of his mind moſt ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to pity and compaſſion. Thus were his ſorrows augmented, and his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings made intollerable, while the rigour of his enemies left no ſound part in him; for he ſuffered in his Soul in his bitter Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; in his whole Body in his Sweat; his

                        <p>Proportionate to the torments which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> endured, was his ſhame and ignominy, than which nothing is more inſufferable to an ingenuous nature. His birth was mean, his Mother a poor Virgin, he was born in a Stable, and Cradled in a Manger; he was brought up at the mean and laborious Trade of his reputed Father <hi>Joſeph;</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Journies were performed on foot; he had no ſetled habitation, and very few Friends, and thoſe poor, ignorant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <hi>Galilean</hi> Fiſhermen, whoſe very Country was ominous; and at his laſt eſſay was he not apprehended as a vile male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and that not by a party of men of Honour, not by the Guards of the Captain of the Temple, or the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor, but by the Rabble, the meaneſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tumultuouſly gathered together, arm'd with Clubs and Swords, the haſty weapons their fury could lay hold on. He was treated as a publick Nuſance, tho as free from ſin as truth and innocence could make him; drag'd from the Garden to the Palace of <hi>Amas,</hi> thence to the Houſe of <hi>Calaphas,</hi> and thence to <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who ſent him to <hi>Herod: Herod</hi> uſed him with all ſort of ſcorn, clad him in Mock-purple, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to the <hi>Roman Procurator,</hi> where
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63922:200"/>the Soldiers and common people ſpit on him, blinded him, ſmote him, and ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally bid him prophecy who did it; he was whipt like a ſlave, while the multitude in their eſteem, prefer to him <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Traytor, a Thief, a Murtherer, a Captain to thoſe ſeditious perſons with whom he made his inſurrection, one publickly and notoriouſly guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, and look'd on as a pernicious wretch, and one of the peſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                        <p>And when he was thus cover'd with blood and ſweat, with ſtripes and the marks of cruelty, with an uneaſie Crown, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous purple, he was brought out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to publick view; he was crucified (a death by which none but ſlaves and the vileſt malefactors were puniſht) and that naked, no regard being had to modeſty or the rules of decency; and in the midſt of the Thieves, as the worſt of all the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors. The High-prieſts mock'd him, the common people ſhook their heads, his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſufferers upbraided him, and all that paſt by did ſhoot out their Arrows, even bitter words; which affronts were not the Ephemerous product of ſudden fury, but the continuation of former injuries; for all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63922:200"/>his life long he was cenſured; his poor parentage thrown in his Teeth, is not this the Carpenter? His Doctrine miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as if he ſpoke againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Temple, and introduc'd falſe Doctrine; his Miracles belied, as if he caſt out Devils by compact with <hi>Satan;</hi> his converſation miſtook, as if his innocent and neceſſary freedom were herding with the profligate, and making friendſhip with publicans and ſinners. Nothing could be more temperate, and yet he is impeached of being a Glutton and a Drunkard; nothing more Chaſt, and yet he is affronted with the title of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Harlots; no man more ſedate and grave, and yet his neareſt Relations ſay he is beſides himſelf; nothing was more Loyal, and yet he is accuſed as an enemy to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> nothing more Pious, and yet he is condemn'd for Blaſphemy: If he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and free in his converſe, then he is popular and ſeditious; if retired, he hath a Devil; and let him cry down hypocriſy never ſo zealouſly, he is reputed an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor: Thus they affronted him in all his capacities. Was he deſigned our High-prieſt, to redeem the world by the ſacrifice of himſelf? They mock him on the Croſs with his Office, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63922:201"/>ſave thy ſelf and us.</hi> Was he ſent to be the great Prophet, to declare the Will of God to mankind? They firſt blind, then ſmite him, and afterward bid him prophecy who ſtruck him. And had God deſign'd him to be a King? They cloath him in Purple, put on his Head a Crown of Thorns, and a Reed in his right hand inſtead of a Scepter. Such was the ill entertainment the holy <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> found, ſuch the rudeneſs of men to their greateſt benefactor, that he, that came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World only to do good, was above all others in it worſt treated. All which indignities could not but ſit more uneaſily upon an innocent perſon, than they would have done on a hardy criminal, who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally takes ſhelter in impudence. And to make the ſhame exquiſite, remember, O my Soul, that this Son of Man was at the ſame time the Son of God.</p>
                        <p>When therefore I repreſent to my ſelf my bleeding Saviour nailed to the accurſed Tree, and view the ſadneſs of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance disfigured with his Sweat, his Blood, and his Tears; when I look upon his wounded ſide, his hands and feet pierc'd, his head crown'd with Thorns, Is not this ſight enough to ſtrike me dumb? enough to ſtrike me dead? when I conſider that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63922:201"/>my ſins have wounded him, and were more troubleſom than his adverſaries malice? Shall the <hi>Jews</hi> be up at midnight to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, and ſhall I not break my ſleep to ſerve him? ſhall the ſinner take more pains to be damn'd, than I to work out my ſalvation with fear and trembling?</p>
                        <p>What ſhall I firſt admire in thee, O my dying Redeemer! for thou art all wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I admire thy willingneſs to ſubmit, for no compulſion could force thee to bear the weight of thy Father's anger; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably true, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> could fall by no hand but his own; and that his Love had ſlain him, before the Spear pierc'd his ſide; and if we may believe the Viſion in St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> thou art ready yet to come down again, and to dye anew, were it any way conducive to the ſalvation of mankind? I admire the miraculouſneſs of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, That he, who graſps the World in his fiſt, ſhould be confined to a Cradle; and he, who ſuſtains Angels, ſhould ſuck the Breaſts of a Virgin! that Vigour it ſelf ſhould languiſh, Eternity become mortal, that Life ſhould give up the ghoſt, and God be crucified, and the ſame perſon at the ſame time in Hell and in Paradiſe! I admire the intireneſs of his reſignation, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63922:202"/>any articles or capitulation, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the managery and conduct of his Father, ſubmitting the habit and the acts of his Will to God, and reſolving to obey in whatever manner he ſhould require. Nor can I forbear admiring and celebrating the earneſtneſs of his Love, who was in great diſtreſs till he had paid our ranſom; but I cannot avoid particular reflections on the advantages of his being crucified pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that the matter of fact might be undeniable, and that the Apoſtles might have no cauſe to be aſhamed of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or the World of their Faith, nor both of their Saviour. What a pattern of reſignation and ſubmiſſion, of meekneſs, and patience, of compaſſion, and love to the worſt of enemies had the Chriſtian world been deprived of, if our beſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had ſuffered in a Corner, or been ſtrangled in a Priſon? It was out of deſign to make his virtues as well as his ſufferings illuſtrious, that he choſe to ſuffer at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> the Metropolis of the Country, and at the Paſſover, when all the Nation were come up to the holy City. Let therefore the Croſs of Chriſt be to the <hi>Jews</hi> an offence and ſcandal (who expect to ſhare with the <hi>Meſſia</hi> in the grandeur of a ſecular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63922:202"/>and let it be to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (who reliſh no notions, but what comport with their eaſe and profit, and think it madneſs to ſlight preſent miſeries, and ſtand in awe of future ſufferings) I will look upon it as the greateſt inſtance of the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that God was pleaſed to teach his Son Obedience, and to make the world happy by the things which he ſuffered. And am I not indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly obliged to follow this pattern, and to imitate this my beſt Friend? Can I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of a naked crucified Saviour, who, when he was ſtript of his Garments, was covered with a robe of honour purpled in his own blood? And ſhould it not be my greateſt honour to be conform'd to the Image of his ſufferings? Hath <hi>Jeſus</hi> carried with him, not only our humane nature, but the marks of his wounds that were given him on Earth, into that Heaven which he opened unto all believers; and do I not long to go to that my greateſt benefactor, into that Heaven which his wounds have purchas'd? And am I not redeemed from my former vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by the Blood of God? And ſhall I continue in ſin, becauſe Grace hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, or dare to damn that Soul for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63922:203"/>which Chriſt died? No, I will endure the contradiction of ſinners, and I will reſiſt, if God ſee fit, unto blood; <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall be my darling, and I will love him as I love my life and Heaven.</p>

                        <p>SAD and diſconſolate muſt needs have been the ſtate of the Infant Church, when its Tutor and Guardian was taken from it; nor could the Diſciples but ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, who were deprived of the light and warmth of the Sun of Righteouſneſs; they had loſt one Comforter, and had only the remote expectations of another; their Maſter had eſtabliſh'd a Kingdom which they knew not what to make of; they could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how a Prince could make himſelf Glorious, and yet trample upon the Pomps and Vanities, the Crowns and Purple which this world adorns its Monarchs with; nor how he who had not ſo much as a Houſe which he could call his own, could be Lord of the whole Earth; nor did they underſtand how this could be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who ſhould redeem all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who could not reſcue himſelf from the Torture and Ignominy of the Croſs; theſe were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Conſiderations, and ſuch as filled their hearts full of ſorrow; theſe thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63922:207"/>the Apoſtles, during the time that their Maſter lay in the Grave, to retirement and privacy, they ſighed and bewailed the loſs of their hopes, which they imagined were buried in the ſame Sepulcher with their Lord, paſt any poſſibility of a Reſurrection. As long as they expected to ſhare in the Grandeur of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and under him to govern Principalities, how willingly did they follow him? but when they ſaw all thoſe ſatisfactions which they promis'd themſelves, vaniſh like the Idea's of a dream, ſorrow could not but fill their hearts: And is not this, O my ſoul, the general practiſe of Mankind? how fond are we of the Glories of Chriſt's Kingdom, but how weary of his Croſs? how ready to follow him to Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> but how unwilling to accompany him to Mount <hi>Calvary?</hi> We run eagerly to the Plain to eat Bread mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by Miracle, but we dread the way that leads to the Mountain, where by day he preach'd his Excellent Sermons, and ſpent the whole Night in Prayers.</p>
                        <p>But is there not alſo, O my Soul, much to be ſaid in the behalf of theſe Apoſtles, which we can never plead to excuſe our own negligence? Their Maſter was now in the Grave, the work of their Redemption
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63922:207"/>not yet perfected, and the Holy Spirit was not yet given, which alone could fill them with Knowledg and Fortitude; in ſuch a diſtreſt condition who can blame their fears and their cowardiſe? but as ſoon as ever they had ſeen the Lord return from the dead, and the Bleſſed Spirit had deſcended on them at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> their hearts were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with joy and reſolution, they then courted the dangers, which before they ſtudiouſly ſhun'd; and with aſſurance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> from whom before they hid themſelves; then they lookt upon the Chains which they wore for the ſake of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as Ornaments of their Hands and Legs; a Priſon was a Palace to them, the Blood that followed their ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, the Purple which they wore, and the place of Execution a Room of State; the Croſs was a Throne, and the Flames a Royal Chariot to convey them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Arm'd with thoſe aſſiſtances not only <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſmiled on Martyrdom, and were in love with dying, but even Women and Children, Perſons of ſtrong ſears and weak powers, of violent Paſſions and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Reaſons, went in ſuch multitudes to the Tribunals to acknowledg themſelves Chriſtians, that they tired their Judges
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63922:208"/>with pronouncing Sentences of Death, and their Executioners with inflicting them: and what is it, O my Soul, that hinders thee from exerting the ſame Gallantry and Reſolution? who beſides all the aſſiſtances which they enjoyed, haſt alſo the advantage of their Examples.</p>
                        <p>Often have I wondred how thoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſons became ſuch admirable Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in the ſchool of the Son of God? How their Piety, their Charity, their Juſtice, and Sobriety, their Love of God, and love to Mankind could be ſo conſpicuous in the eyes of their Heathen Adverſaries, while they contended earneſtly for the Faith, when nothing but Bonds, Impriſonment, and Death, nothing but Shame and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were their Portion? Whereas now, when the Chriſtian Religion is countenanc'd and cheriſh'd by Authority, and the good things of this life are its reward as well as the joys of a better, we are more profane and irreligious, more unjuſt and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, more luſtful and intemperate than the vileſt Heathens: And perhaps this is not the worſt reaſon that can be given of it, that in thoſe days the greater part of Chriſtians were converted after they came to years of diſcretion, when the Church
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63922:208"/>required from them all ſorts of teſtimonies of their vertue and their conſtancy before they were admitted into it; bringing them up, when <hi>Catechumens,</hi> under a ſevere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, acquainting them with the ſtrictneſs of the Laws of Religion, inuring them to Faſtings and Abſtinencies, to frequent Prayers, and frequent Watchings, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch hardſhips; to a publick and ſolemn renouncing of their own luſts, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contempt of the world; for by this means Religion was indeared to them, who before their admiſſion to the priviledges of it, had conquer'd all their Paſſions, and were crucified to the World, and had upon the matureſt deliberation choſen <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the Croſs, before the Honours, Wealth, and Voluptuouſneſs of this life. Whereas now our admiſſion is in our Infancy, when our ſponſors promiſe of courſe for us, what we never care to make good: and we are admitted to the priviledges before we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the duties of Chriſtianity; ſo that we take up our Religion as we do our Cloaths, or our Cuſtoms, becauſe they were the practices of our Fore-fathers, and are the garb of the preſent time: And perhaps it is alſo conſiderable, that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity often cheats us, when we are proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63922:209"/>all the temptations of adverſity; worldly eaſe ſoftens us, while a ſtate of affliction and trouble becomes a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. And ſo in truth is it, a Chriſtian not deſerving his name, till he be a Convert from ſenſuality to a crucified Saviour: So when the Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> coveted places of Truſt and Honour in an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Monarchy,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.21.</note> our Bleſſed Redeemer told them, that the preferments of his Court old not conſiſt in fitting at his Right and left Hand, but in drinking of his Cup, and being baptized with his Baptiſm. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was called to an Apoſtleſhip,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 9.16.</note> the Lord told <hi>Ananias</hi> in a Viſion, that his Miſſion was not deſign'd to Triumph over the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, nor ſhould his Revelations diſcover to him, what Kingdoms he ſhould convert (tho that he did) but I will ſhow him, ſays God, what great things he muſt ſuffer for my Names ſake. And this that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle well underſtood;
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</note> for when he reckons up the ſigns of an Apoſtle, he begins with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under affliction, as if that generoſity of mind, that ſlighted the Tribulations at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63922:209"/>on the Goſpel, was a more eminent and ſurer ſign of his Apoſtleſhip than all his power of working Signs and Wonders, and mighty deeds: for to be afflicted was to be clad in the beſt Livery of the great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Shepherd of Souls. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolve to imitate thoſe admirable guides of the Church in their ſorrow. I will lament the death of my Saviour, and hate my ſins that crucified him. I will as they did, retire from the World and love it no longer, becauſe it deſpiſed my dear Redeemer: And I will alſo imitate them in their Patience and their Courage. I will endure all things for the ſake of my friend, who died for me; and nothing ſhall fright me from following the pattern, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſteps of his firſt and beſt ſervants.</p>

                        <p>AMong all our Bleſſed Saviour's unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes, the incapacities of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples underſtandings was not the leaſt; by reaſon of which, tho their Maſter was the Wiſdom of the Father, and endowed with the Holy-Ghoſt without meaſure, which enabled him to ſpeak, not only vvith the greateſt authority, but vvith the greateſt veracity and plainneſs; yet they vvere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvays unvvilling to give entire credit to his ſayings. Some of them they could not underſtand, and others they vvould not believe. So, vvhen he diſcourſed of the great myſtery of the Sacrament, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred, that no Man could have life in him, except he did eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood; many of his follovvers apprehended that he vvould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to turn <hi>Canibals,</hi> and ſo vvent back, and vvalked no more vvith him. Among vvhom St. <hi>Mark</hi> himſelf, ſay the Ancients, vvas diſguſted, and left that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Society: and had not St. <hi>Peter</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63922:217"/>reclaimed him, the Church had loſt that Evangeliſt. Nor was St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf free from this crime; for vvhen our bleſſed Saviour gave the Twelve an account of his ſufferings, and that the redemption of the World was to be accompliſh'd by his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, he, whoſe mind was poſſeſt with other notions of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> was ſcandalized at the declaration, and rebuked his Lord, not knovving that our Saviour's Croſs vvas to be his Throne, and by his Agonies only he was to merit Crovvns and earn Triumphs. Nor could all that their infallible Guide could ſay to inform them better, drive out this notion out of the heads of the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, no not vvhen they ſavv him crucified, dead and buried, and could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he promiſed to riſe again the Third day. The Women, more officious than vviſe, had brought Spices to embalm him, as if the Lamb of God had fallen like a common Sacrifice, as if the Lord of Hoſts had been captivated by the Grave, his Povvers baffled, and his Promiſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel'd And tho the empty Sepulchre, the ſight of the Grave-cloaths orderly laid up, and the teſtimony of the Angel vvere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable proofs, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not there,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63922:217"/>but was riſen; yet their admiration was ſtronger than their Faith, and the Diſciples of both ſexes were ſurpriſed, they hardly believed their eyes (for as yet, they knew not the Scriptures, that he muſt riſe from the dead) and wondred at all that was come to paſs.</p>
                        <p>In the head of thoſe devout female pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites was <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> who, tho once an Angel of darkneſs, had now the purity and zeal of one of the <hi>Seraphim;</hi> ſhe was all ardor and reſolution, ſhe was the firſt who went to the Sepulchre on the day of the Reſurrection; ſhe was earlier up than the beloved Diſciple, who lay in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's boſome, and for that reaſon ſhould have afforded his Maſter a place in his own heart, in his memory, and in his love; and ſhe had more courage than <hi>Peter,</hi> tho a man of extraordinary fervor; ſhe dreaded not the guards, nor the ſhadows of the night that had not yet given place to day, but haſtens her ſteps to the venerable Tomb; and when ſhe beheld the empty Sepulchre, how deep is her concern at the loſs of her Saviour? She wept bitterly, as if ſhe would have ſoftned the Rock, and made the moſt inſenſible and obdurate parts of the Creation mourn with her the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63922:218"/>death of her beſt Friend. And tho theſe were ſad diſappointments, and the ſight had affrighted all that followed her, yet there ſhe ſtill continues, ſhe was the laſt who return'd from that awful Garden; nor did ſhe at length miſs of her expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for they who ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy. The Angels firſt confirm her hopes, and immediately after, the Lord of the Angels gave her a view of his ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>Remember, O my Soul, the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our Saviour after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was to the moſt ſinful <hi>Magdalene;</hi> nor do thou deſpair, but that thou maiſt alſo be admitted to a ſhare in his favour; but remember alſo, that this honour was vouchſafed to the penitent <hi>Magdalene,</hi> to <hi>Magdalene</hi> tranſported with the ardors of Divine Love, that had deſtroyed all the heats of Luſt. If thou longeſt therefore to be bleſt with ſuch priviledges, riſe early, and begin betime to ſerve thy Maker; weep over thy follies that have deprived thee of the company of thy Saviour; and theſe methods will recall thy departed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and thy ſins, which are many, ſhall be forgiven, becauſe thou haſt loved much. To <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> among the ſofter Sex,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63922:218"/>was the firſt appearance vouchſafed; and among the men the next was to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> the firſt, a Woman of the looſeſt manners, and moſt profligate converſation; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a Man of ſtrong boaſtings, and a weak faith, who, when he promiſed to dye with his Maſter, denied him; thus the worſt of ſinners had the preference in this diſcovery; and why ſhould I doubt, but that there is mercy alſo for me, and my Saviour hath the ſame compaſſion for my Soul as he had for <hi>Mary Magdalen's</hi> or St. <hi>Peter's. Magdalene</hi> was our Saviour's firſt Apoſtle after his Reſurrection, ſhe had a commiſſion to inſtruct St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, and the beloved Virgin too, and to tell them their Lord had left the ſhadows of the Grave, and would meet that diſconſolate Family of his on one of the Mountains of <hi>Galilee:</hi> And tho ſhe faithfully diſcharged that Embaſſy, yet ſuch is the power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that they knew not how to believe her. They were amuſed at what they ſaw and heard, but they did not underſtand the myſtery; the wonderful tranſactions of that day took up all their thoughts, and, wherever they went, this part of the ſacred Hiſtory was the ſubject of their diſcourſes.</p>
                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:63922:219"/>
                        <p>Two of the followers of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly two of the ſeventy Diſciples, of which one was <hi>Cleophas</hi> (who perhaps was the ſame with <hi>Alpheus</hi>) and the other is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured to be either <hi>Simeon</hi> his ſon, or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael,</hi> or St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf, or ſome other of our Lord's Diſciples, being unhappily defeated of their expectations of worldly pomp, and overwhelm'd with ſorrow for the ignominious death of their Lord, and full of fears, leſt the power of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> that had crucified their Maſter, might alſo extirpate his whole family (for by this time the Soldiers having revealed the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, had been bribed by the High-Prieſts to ſay, that his Diſciples came by night and ſtole him away while they ſlept) reſolved to divert their griefs, and ſecure their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by a ſhort journey to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> whence, probably having given up all their hopes of ever ſeeing the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> again, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to retire into <hi>Galilee</hi> (if <hi>Emmaus</hi> were not the birth-place of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> as is affirmed) for they truſted, that he had been the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, they, who were his kindred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, ſhould have met with places of honour, truſt and profit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of ſuch a Prince grown
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63922:219"/>great and glorious; all which hopes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, they reſolved to retire to their old abodes and employment. And yet they had not ſo put off their reſpects and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their heavenly Inſtructor, but that they entertain themſelves with his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, their reſentments of his ſufferings being quick and paſſionate; the death of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the diſcourſe of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for ſuch a Prophet ſo mighty in word and deed could not fall ſilently and in the dark; but his widowed Family talked of it feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and every circumſtance of his ſhame, and of his tortures, pierc'd the heart of the Relator, and filled it full of grief and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment before it reach'd the ears, and moved the pity of the Auditors. Nor does Piety ever want its reward; he who medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates or diſcourſes of heavenly things, is ſeldome without an Angel to be his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and companion; but here the Prince of the Angels condeſcends to be a fellow tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller and inſtructor.</p>
                        <p>And now the good men may ceaſe their diſpute, there is no longer any need of arguing whether the Redeemer be riſen or not, when himſelf demonſtrates the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, both of his ſufferings and his triumphs, out of the unerring Oracles; when both
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63922:220"/>
                           <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the other Prophets teſtify, that the Son of Man ought to have ſuffered theſe things, and then to enter into his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And canſt thou doubt, O my Soul, of the truth of any of the ſublimer myſteries of Religion, when thy Saviour reveals them? How eaſily may my ſhallow reaſon be impos'd upon? but the Wiſdom of God can neither deceive, nor be deceived.</p>
                        <p>Chearing and Comfortable were thoſe diſcourſes to <hi>Cleophas</hi> and his companion; and as pleaſant and acceptable, as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume that is made by the art of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary; they were ſweet as Honey in the mouth, and as Muſick at a banquet of Wine. The converſation was ſo charming and advantageous, that it leſſen'd the way, and brought them eaſily to the Gates of <hi>Emmaus.</hi> And when <hi>Jeſus</hi> made ſhow, as if he would have gone farther, they, knowing themſelves to be obliged in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to treat him who had ſo plentifully fed their minds with heavenly dainties, conſtrain him by their civilities to tarry with them; and as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s hoſpitality gave him an opportunity of entertaining the Son of God and his Angels, ſo the friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the two Diſciples, was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their being longer bleſt with their
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63922:220"/>Saviour's company. With them he ſate at Table, and when he had taken Bread and bleſt it, when he had broken and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted it to them, then their eyes were opened, then they knew the Lord of Life. Perhaps this bleſſing and breaking of Bread did only relate to the common meal which they were then making; and yet it no way interferes with the Laws of Religion (nor does it indeed maintain the Sacrilege of the half-communion) if it be underſtood of the bleſſed Euchariſt, which is a lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Crucifixion; and moſt likely it is, that, this being one of the great myſteries of Chriſtianity, his Diſciples ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſh'd him from other men by the uſe of this Rite. And where can I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet my Saviour with comfort, but at his Table? That Sacrament gives light and grace, that Sacrament will better my knowledg, and ſtrengthen my faith, and ſecure my hopes. I will therefore covet all opportunities of converſing with my Saviour at his own Table. 'Twas the higheſt honour that could be given to St. <hi>John</hi> on earth, to lye in his Saviour's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom (the moſt valued and beſt beloved perſon in the company, being allowed a place next to the Maſter of the Feaſt) and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63922:221"/>the priviledges of Heaven are deſcribed by a place in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom: But is it not a greater honour, when Chriſt ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to lye in my boſom, to enter into my mouth, and to become the food of my ſoul?</p>
                        <p>This was ſuch raviſhing and unexpected news, that (tho <hi>Jeſus</hi> preſently on this manifeſtation of himſelf diſappear'd out of their ſight, miraculouſly withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Table) they immediately return'd to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to communicate this news to their ſorrowful brethren; and there they met with new confirmations, for <hi>Peter</hi> had alſo ſeen his Lord; and while they were thus diſcourſing of this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous return from the Grave, lo, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter conveys himſelf unſeen into the Room, and ſtanding in the midſt of them, by his ſeaſonable conſolations, ſcatters the clouds that eclips'd their joys, raiſed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſpirits, invigorates them with new courage, promiſes them his own preſence for forty days, and after his Aſcenſion, the continual preſence and aſſiſtances of the bleſſed Spirit: For all theſe were the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes which the Conqueror beſtowed on his followers; theſe were the products of his Reſurrection. How ignorant were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63922:221"/>before this time, of the Perſon and Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the other myſteries of Religion? But when <hi>Jeſus</hi> viſited them in his return from the gloomy ſhades, how were they filled with all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and knowledg, and joy in the Holy-Ghoſt? Wiſdom, not only to underſtand the ſtate of Chriſtianity but to confront the Philoſophers at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> to baffle the Scribes and Phariſees at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and to convert the whole World from ſin and wickedneſs, to be Proſelytes to the Laws of Chriſt. Before their Maſter's Crucifixion, how daſtardly and low-ſpirited were even the very Apoſtles, tho they lived, and dayly converſed with him? their courages were impaired by their ſears, they betrayed, deſerted, and denied him; but his Reſurrection did beget in the mind of the Chriſtian World a true generoſity and fortitude, able to ſubdue and trample on all dangers, in as much as men of no breeding, no natural valour, of no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, or friends, durſt prefer the confeſſion of their Saviour and his Goſpel to their Countrey and Relations, to their qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and ſecurity, and to life it ſelf, and paſſionately to chuſe ſcourges and priſons, and the various methods of death, before
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63922:222"/>all ſorts of voluptuous enjoyments. But what is more and more acceptable than all knowledg, and all power; the Reſurrection of Chriſt gave the Holy-Ghoſt to the World; for the bleſſed Spirit could not be given till Chriſt was riſen. Thus this one act of the Almighty Redeemer of mankind baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled all the fears of his ſervants, compleated the ſatisfaction for their ſins, &amp; ſecured unto them the company of the Spirit of Truth &amp; Peace here, till they ſhould be carried into his Kingdom on the wings of Angels. And what greater bleſſings canſt thou wiſh than theſe, O my ſoul? Give the riches and the honours of this life, O my deareſt Saviour, to others, I will never envy their fruitions, ſo thou give me thy Self; let me partake of the benefits of thy Reſurrection in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my ſins, in the indwelling of the Comforter in my mind, and in the firſt fruits of obedience, in frequent approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to thy Table, and other acts of devout converſe with thee, and (leaving the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my death to thy diſpoſal, for on theſe terms in what ſort, or at what time ſoever it ſhall be, I ſhall not be diſturbed) I ſhall be happy in the remembrance, that when my Maſter comes, and finds me ſo doing, he will give me a ſhare in his joys.</p>

And whenever the Chriſtian Penitent goes to bed, it is requiſite to riſe very early on <hi>Eaſter day,</hi> becauſe our Bleſſed Maſter roſe

After the private devotions are performed, and the neceſſary duties of the Family (if any) conſidered and attended, the good man goes to Church; nor will he chooſe to receive any other where, but at his own Pariſh Church, if there be a Sacrament there, which on this Feſtival is expreſly enjoined to be celebrated over all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

                           <hi>Jew</hi> who could not poſſibly go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> had the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to kill a Lamb at Home, and to call upon the Name of the Lord; praiſing him for the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                        <p>§. 4. But if by any means he can go to Church, he chuſes to be there ſome time before the Holy Offices begin, that he may the better compoſe himſelf, recollect his Thoughts, and review his Vows; for he who wilfully ſlips the opportunity of being at the beginning of the Prayers, is in the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63922:225"/>way to loſe all the advantages of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither; for he who does not confeſs heartily, cannot communicate worthily. Early therefore the good man goes to Church, and he takes care to come faſting, that nothing may enter into his mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Body of God; for for this cauſe the Ancients transferr'd their Love-feaſts from being eaten before the Sacrament, to be eaten after it, not only to prevent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but to do Honour to this Heavenly Food, by preſerring it to all our temporal neceſſaries: And yet the good man is not ſo ſcrupulous to believe, that if, while he waſhes his mouth, a drop of water caſually trickle down his Throat, that that breaks his Faſt, and diſables him to communicate that day.</p>
                        <p>§. 5. The ſpare time before the ſervice begins, is ſpent in holy reflections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vows of obedience, ſuch as theſe:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the name of Jeſus who loved me, and was crucified for me, I renounce my ſelf, and all my own deſires, that I may love my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and do him ſervice: May his Croſs and Paſſiion ſave me, may his Grace keep and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me in the paths of Peace, world without end.</hi>

                           <hi>Be glad and rejoice, O my ſoul, and give Honour to the Lord God Omnipotent, for the Marriage of the Lamb is come; Bleſſed are all they who are called to the Marriage-Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb: Theſe are the true ſayings of God.

                        <p>To which is ſubjoined this Meditation.</p>
                        <p>§ 6 I am come into the Temple of God to receive his Injunctions, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Bleſſings; I entertain the tidings with Joy and the Exultations of a glad heart: this is the day which the Lord hath made, I will tejoice and be glad in it: this is the Lords day, and this his Habitation, where it pleaſeth him to dwell: O how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable are thy dwellings, O thou Lord of Hoſts? Here the Angels wait and worſhip, and if they veil their faces, being raviſhed at the Tranſporting and Majeſtick Sight, how cold and negligent am I in my prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to entertain the lover of Souls, my comforter in this world, and my bliſs in that which is to come; the guide of thoſe vvho travel to <hi>Zion,</hi> and the revvard of vvhoever attains to the Heavenly country? Had I the Meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Job,</hi> the Zeal of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63922:226"/>Purities of the Man after Gods ovvn heart, yet vvere I not meet to approach Gods Holy Table. Could the Seraphim transfer to me their ardours, or the bright Angels cloath me with their innocency, yet it would be infinite Condeſcention in my God to admit me. Lord! What then ſhall I do? If I come, I am afraid of preſumption; but if I refuſe to come, I ſlight thy invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I contemn thy Ordinances, and affront thy Goodneſs; I break thy Commandments, and throw off my ſubjection. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come, tho I bring not with me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire preparation which the Sanctuary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; for he who deſpiſeth thy Table, is as guilty in thy ſight, as he who eats and drinks unworthily.</p>
                        <p>Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof, and yet thon biddeſt thy ſelf to be my Gueſt, and intreateſt to be admitted into my Boſom: the greateſt Prince condeſcends to viſit his meaneſt ſubject, and the Holieſt God to dwell with the moſt ſinful Wretch. Lord, I have ſinned, and done exceeding wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And can my God look ſavourably on ſuch an abominable Tranſgreſſor as I am? Can thy Mercy incline thee to take the Childrens Bread, and to give it to ſuch a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63922:227"/>Dog? I acknowledg I am an Intruder, but <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> whom thou lovedſt, and to whom thon forgaveſt much, when ſhe made her firſt Addreſſes to thee, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> came unbidden to the houſe of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious <hi>Phariſee;</hi> when the Meat was on the Table, and without taking notice of any body elſe, laid hold of thee whom ſhe earneſtly ſought, at thy feet ſhe throws her ſelf, and waſhes them with her penitential Tears; ſhe was aſhamed of her ſins, but not of her approaches to her Saviour; and ſo am I: Oh! how am I grieved that I am yet ſo far from the power of Godlineſs, ſo intangled with the love of vanity, ſo fond of the world, and ſo negligent of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo prodigal of my time, and ſuch a niggard of my Charity; ſo vain in my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſo inconſiderate in my diſcourſes, ſo indevotional in the moſt ſolemn acts of Religion, but ſo intent to things of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo concern'd about my daily Bread, but ſo careleſs of getting the Bread of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ſo inclinable to be angry with others while I want that indignation that becomes me againſt my own tranſgreſſions. May the good Lord be merciful to me, and to every one who prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God, the God of our Fathers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63922:227"/>he be not cleanſed according to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Sanctuary.</p>
                        <p>§ 7. After this, it is taken for granted, that the good Man who is Gods Miniſter, and the Peoples Prieſt, is come to Church, and hath begun the Divine Service, at which the devout Chriſtian earneſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, praying with all fervency,
<note n="o" place="margin">Receiving the Abſolution with all Contrition and Humility.</note> praiſing God with all heartineſs; repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creed with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt vigour, becauſe it is a confirmation of the truth of his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and tho he takes all occaſions when there is any pauſe, as frequently there is in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, to put up his own private Prayers to God, yet he never dares ſuffer them to interfere with the publick worſhip; for

                        <p>§. 8. When the devout Chriſtian obſerves the Holy Man of God (for ſuch is every Prieſt, or ſuch he ought to be) ſtanding at the Altar, he looks on him with Reverence, becauſe he miniſters in Holy Things, and repreſents <hi>Jeſus</hi> conſecrating at the firſt Inſtitution. And for him thus he prays.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord let thy Prieſts be cloath'd with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and let thy Saints ſing with joyfulneſs.</hi>

                        <p>§ 9. When the devont Chriſtian is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to draw near to the Holy Table, he uſes one or more of theſe Sentencs,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord I have looked for thee in Holineſs, that I might behold thy Power and Glory.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>This is the Lords Mercy-Seat, which the Cherubim of Glory ſhadow; this is the Altar of Jeſus, round which the Angels, clad in their bright Robes, ſtand.</hi>

                        <p>

                           <hi>I will come into thy Houſe upon the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy Mercies, and in thy fear will I

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I will exalt the Lord my God, and will worſhip at his Footſtool, for he is Holy; I will fall down, and adore, for I know, that God is here of a truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§ 10. VVhen the good man comes up, and kneels before the Altar, he ſays, <hi>Lord, I moſt thankfully receive this gracious Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which thou haſt afforded me, to come to thy Holy Table; and tho the number and weight of my Tranſgreſſions might juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, yet I am reſolved to embrace the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, becauſe thou haſt bidden all who are weary and heavy laden, to come unto thee.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oh, that I could entertain thee in my Soul with the ſame joy that the Holy Virgin did at thy incarnation; with the ſame Exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the Infant Baptiſt did, when he danc'd before he was Born, at the approach of a Saviour; with the Hoſannah's of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi> Jews <hi>before thy Paſſion, and with the Authems of Angels at thy Aſcenſion.</hi>

                           <hi>For who deſerves my praiſes, but my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? Worthy is the Lamb who was ſlain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and

                           <hi>My Soul therefore ſhall joyn conſort with every Creature, which is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, when they ſay, Bleſſing, and Honour and Glory, and Power be unto him that ſits on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Lord hear thee, the name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>defend thee; ſend thee help from the Sanctuary, and ſtrengthen thee out of</hi> Zion; <hi>Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy Sacrifice; Grant thee thy hearts deſire, and fulfil all thy mind.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord, I am the greateſt of ſinners, but here is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World. His Blood ſpeaks better things than that of</hi> Abel, <hi>and he is the propititation for our ſins.</hi>

                           <hi>My ſins, deareſt Jeſu, brought thee to all thy ſhame, and all thy ſufferings; but that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was neceſſary for the Redemption of the World; I am troubled above meaſure for

                        </p>
                        <p>§ 13. To which he ſubjoins this, or the like act of Faith:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jeſus is my God and my Saviour, he is the Angel of the Covenant, I will not leave him till he bleſs me.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>This is Jeſus, whom the</hi> Jews <hi>ſlew, and hanged on a Tree; him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>

                           <hi>If God hath given us his Son, how ſhall he not with him give us all things? for his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed. Lord, I believe that thou art preſent in the Sacrament, but in a manner ſpiritual and ineffable; to think that thou art here corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, bids defiance to my ſenſes and my reaſon, and debaſes thy glorified humanity; and to imagine that I receive nothing more than bare ſigns, is to rob my ſelf of the benefit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with thee: Let me feel the truth of that myſtery which I admire and believe, but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63922:230"/>cannot prove; and let me experiment the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects of this Sacrament, tho I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the particular manner how they are derived to me. Thou haſt convinc'd me that the fleſh profiteth nothing, but thy Words are ſpirit and life; as therefore thou haſt made it, ſo I humbly and thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Let it be unto thy ſervant according to thy word: and grant that the days may come ſhortly, when Faith ſhall be ſwallowed up of Viſion,</hi> Amen.</p>
                        <p>§ 14. If many others Communicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, the good man employs that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in reflecting upon the Office of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration; and becauſe he could not without diſturbance interpoſe his ejaculations, while the Prieſt was ſaying the Prayer of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, he takes this occaſion to ſay,</p>
                        <p>When the Prieſt carries the Patin,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for the cure of the wounded</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>ſo was our deareſt Saviour lifted up on the Croſs for the redemption of a world of ſinners.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Lord, evermore give me this bread.</hi> When the Prieſt breaks the Bread, he ſays,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So was the Body of Jeſus mangled, ſo was his fleſh torn, till there was no whole place in his body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Prieſt pours out the Wine, he ſays,</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>So when Jeſus was in his Agony, ſo when he was ſcourged, crowned with Thorns, and nailed to the accurſed Tree, did the Blood run down: ſo Jeſus loved us, and waſh'd us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the Prieſt carries the Chalice, he ſays,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is the Blood of Jeſus that makes atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being ſhed for me, and for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>§ 15. When the Prieſt takes the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his hands to give them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtian, he remembers, that ſo God offers his Son to be the Author of Eternal Salvation to every believer; ſo hath God fitted <hi>Jeſus</hi> a body, and indowed him with the ſpirit above meaſure, that whoſoever believes in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
                        <p>§ 16. When the Prieſt delivers the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the worthy Communicant, he conſiders that there are two parts in the form of diſtribution, a Prayer, and an Advice; the Prayer in theſe words, <hi>The Body (the Blood) of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt preſerve thy Body and Soul unto everlaſting
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63922:231"/>Life;</hi> to which, with much devotion, and an audible voice, he heartily ſays <hi>Amen,</hi> as a teſtimony of his ſtrongeſt deſires that it may be ſo; and of his firm belief, that God will make it ſo.

Tho the devout Communicant brings with him unſatisfied ardors, yet he takes care to receive decently and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, not to ſnatch at the Bread, nor to drink greedily, for it is a Feaſt of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; and therefore the Bread is given in a little piece, and the Wine was ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with Water, as for other reaſons, ſo for this, that it might not offend the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63922:231"/>Head. He therefore eats, not as one whoſe antecedent faſtings have made him hungry, but as one who is little concern'd how his Body be provided for, ſo the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Soul be ſatisfied with ſpiritual food; and he drinks, not with the men of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to be drunk at this Feaſt of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor ſo much to allay his natural thirſt, as to ſatisfie the intenſe deſires of his mind, inflamed with love to his Saviour and the Holy Sacrament: For at God's Table we are to eat and drink, not to the ſatisfaction of our ſenſual appetites, but to the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our Souls.</p>
                        <p>§. 18. While the myſteries are diſtribute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe who receive after him, the good man examines his obligations to God's bounty in giving him one opportunity more of ſerving him in the beauties of holineſs. He remembers, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> being made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of death was crowned with glory and honour; and conſiders, that now he is crucified with Chriſt, that he might live to God, and that the life that he now leads in the fleſh, he lives by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him, and gave himſelf for him. He offers himſelf a ſacrifice to God, and for the future looks
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63922:232"/>on himſelf as ſomething conſecrated, and that can no longer, without moſt prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sacriledg, be put to any profane uſe. For how ſhall he dare to defile that which God hath ſanctified? For if <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> were puniſh'd for quaffing in the Veſſels of the Temple, how much more ſhall that man be plagued that pollutes the reſidence of the Son of God? And how ſhall that man preſume to appear again before God, that ſins againſt him after the receipt of ſuch bleſſings?</p>

And becauſe the <hi>Love-feaſts</hi> ſucceeded the Euchariſt (which are alſo now diſuſed) that he may do ſomething that is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thereunto, he invites one or more of his poorer Neighbours (for the rich are in no need of it) to dine with him, treating them with all affability, and humble car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, relieving their bodily wants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63922:234"/>their minds, and by this means earning their Prayers: And this he does over and above what he hath given at the <hi>Offertory,</hi> where he hath liberally accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ability, offered unto God and the Poor, remembring that a thinking Heathen never came in ſight of an Altar, tho but occaſionally, but he tendred ſomething thereon, if it were but a little Salt, or a handful of Flower; and thought himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo obliged to provide for the indigent, as for his brethren.</p>

No, my moſt obliging Saviour, I make an intire oblation of my ſelf to thee, a whole burnt-offering ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in the flames of holy love, and this I do with all my might and power: nothing could atone for my ſins but thy ſufferings; nor can any thing teſtify my gratitude, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting of my ſelf to thy ſervice.

And if that be an Honour that I am not worthy of, (and perhaps not capable of) yet, O Lord, let me always be thy Martyr in reſolution; and ſince there is ſo much happineſs in communicating with thee, let

I Am now return'd from that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place that is preferable to Paradiſe, where I have been treated with a Feaſt of fat Things, and Wine well refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and what does my Lord require of me in point of Gratitude for theſe his ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefits, but to do Juſtice, to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with my God? For every thing in this Sacrament obliges me to holineſs of Life, the Inſtitutor of it was the undefiled High Prieſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who did bear all ſins, but committed none; the end of its Celebration is to ſhow forth his Death, which when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive unworthily, we act over again, we new crucifie the Lord of Life, who hath
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63922:237"/>bought us, and bring on our ſelves the moſt horrid and affrighting guilt that we can incur; the preparation is nothing leſs than a ſtrict examination of our Conſciences, than ſtrong Prayers and Cries, ardent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of being better, and a conſtant courſe of pious and charitable Actions. This Sacrament actually enters us into Covenant with God, and what agreement can there be between Light and Darkneſs? It is an Emblem of our holy Profeſſion, which calls us to an exemplary Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is a bond of Chriſtian Communion, and obliges to Charity; 'tis a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour's Crucifixion, and ſo calls to the practice of Patience, Forgiveneſs, and Holy Reſolution; and it is a ſolemn Sacrifice of Praiſe, and ſo obliges to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Gratitude.</p>
                        <p>How wide are thy Wounds, O my dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviour, and how ſorrowful thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance? Oh thy bitter Agony! Oh thy ſhameful Croſs! And all occaſioned by my ſins; and ſhall I continue in the ſame Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions out of deſpite to my Saviour? Lord, let me never be in any capacity to do ſo any more; for how ſhall I dare to eat with thee, and to lift up my heel againſt thee? In this Sacrament I renew the Vow
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63922:238"/>which I made in my Baptiſm, and have ſo often ſhamefully broken, and thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the bleſſings which were promis'd me upon the performance of my duty. Now this Covenant, as on Gods part it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles me to his Protection, and his love, to the Merits of his Son, and the indwelling of his Holy Spirit; ſo on my part it engages me to accept of that Son of his in all his Offices, obliging me to receive him as my Sovereign, and to obey his Commands, and to depend upon him; to receive him as my High Prieſt, and to believe that his Sacrifice of himſelf, if I repent and amend, ſhall cleanſe me from all ſin, but if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my diſobedience, ſhall avail me nothing; and to give my ſelf up to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as a Prophet, learning from him all the particulars of the Divine Will, that are neceſſary to make me wiſe to Salvation, and perfect unto every good Work. But how often have I broken that Covenant, rebell'd againſt this my Sovereign, made my ſelf unworthy of the bleſſing of this my High Prieſt, and caſt all his Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind my back?</p>
                        <p>Before my Repentance, my boſom was a Den of Thieves, and a Cage of unclean Birds; but now it is cleanſed, and I am
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63922:238"/>become a new Creature; now know I that I am the Temple of God, and that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwells in me; but if any man defile the Temple of God, him ſhall God deſtroy, for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple I am. There is a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Veneration paid to the places where Princes uſually entertain themſelves; and every Houſe where any of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Perſia</hi> is born, is afterward converted to a Sanctuary; and whereever any of their Princes lodges in a Journey, the place is reputed for the future, ſacred; and ought not the place where my God takes up his Habitation, to be for the ſame reaſon ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from profane and common uſes? And if ſome of the <hi>School-Doctors</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> tell us, that as ſoon as the conſecrated Hoſt grows mouldy, the Body of God retires from it, and it is again changed into its old ſubſtance of bread: can I think that God will pitch his Tents in a polluted Soul infected with the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Vice? I do therefore reſolve, and it ſhall from henceforward be the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my time and my ſtrength ſo to live in thy fear, and to thy ſervice, that I may dye in thy favour, and reſt in thy Peace, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                        <p>§. 31. At the end of this Meditation, this Collect is fitly ſubjoined.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>BLeſſed and most bountiful Saviour, as thou haſt honoured me, and made me happy this day, ſo vouchſafe me the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace, the ſame ardors of Mind, and the ſame holy opportunities all the days of my Life; fix my thoughts upon the things of Heaven; ſtrengthen and inflame my love to my dying Saviour, increaſe and ſupport my Faith, confirm and ſecure my Hopes, and give me fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions to exerciſe all the other Virtues of my Chriſtian Calling; and as thou haſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my ſoul with the moſt raviſhing and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting pleaſures, ſo make me for ever careful that I neither quench thy Bleſſed Spirit, nor ſtifle its Motions, but that I may improve all the ſeaſons of Mercy, and all the tendries of Grace to the beſt ends and purpoſes, to the advancement of thy Glory and my own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through thy Merits and Mediation, who with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, liveſt and reigneſt ever one God, world without end,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                        <p>§. 32. After this the devout man is all Rapture, and all Joy, and cannot forbear praiſing God afreſh for all his ſpiritual bleſſings in Heavenly Places, in this or the like Hymn.</p>
                        <pb n="249" facs="tcp:63922:239"/>
                        <p>O <hi>God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready, I will ſing, and give praiſe with the beſt Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I have.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the people, and I will ſing praiſes unto thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For thy mercy is greater than the Heavens, and thy truth reacheth unto the Clouds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Through God ſhall we do great acts, and it is he that ſhall tread down our enemies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Truly God is loving unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>even unto ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oh how amiable are thy dwellings, thou Lord of Hoſts! my ſoul hath a deſire and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter into the Courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh rejoice in the Living God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe heart are thy ways.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bleſſed are they who dwell in thy Houſe, they will alway be praiſing thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Glory be to the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which he ſubjoins this Act of Love to <hi>'Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I love and admire thee, my deareſt Jeſus, I honour and adore thee above all things: the moſt glorious and uſeful things in nature are contemptible in compariſon of thee: to know thee is beyond all notion, and to love thee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63922:240"/>than triumphs. I am poor without thee, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs and forlorn, but Heaven it ſelf, didſt not thou reſide there, would loſe its amiableneſs. Oh the deareſt name of my adorable Saviour, how ſweet is it beyond the taſte of delicacies to my pallat, how pleaſant beyond the Harmony of Angels to my ears: how doth the ſound of thoſe ſyllables refreſh and chear my drooping ſoul? And when Satan urges to me the remembrance of my ſins, how do I affront and baffle all his attempts by the powerful Name of Jeſus? I can tender thee nothing,</hi> O <hi>my moſt obliging and benign Saviour, as a recompence of the infinite and miraculous teſtimonies of thy Compaſſion, but a few impotent vows, and verbal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments; my whole ſtock of ſervices, were my powers as great, and my life as long as that of Angels, would never repay one half of the debt which I owe thee: but if love and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will make thee ſatisfaction, I will love and adore thee for ever: I will religiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee in my memory, where nothing ſhall efface the characters: From this day I renounce all other loves, and turn Apoſtate from the world, to be a Convert to Jeſus: Oh that I had no neceſſities of nature to gratifie, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of the World to divert me, that I might always celebrate, and always love my Jeſus. How much time ſhould I redeem from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63922:240"/>impertinencies, and conſecrate to Religion, and the ſervice of my Redeemer: and what a Heaven upon Earth would this be! I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be poor, and a Pilgrim, to be deſpiſed and perſecuted, ſo I may enjoy thee, for where thou art, there is Heaven; and where thou art not, there is Hell: and Death and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeize that man whom thou deſerteſt. Lord, keep me firm to theſe reſolutions, that I may live with thee, and love thee for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
                        <p>§. 33. This Act of Love is alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the following Act of Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>So amiable is the faireſt of Ten Thouſand, and ſo beneficial are his injunctions, that I ſhould baffle my intereſts as well as my Reaſon and my Conſcience, ſhould not I devote my ſelf to his ſervice; from this day forward, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I make Jeſus my Maſter, his Majeſty will I reverence, and his ſanctions obey, and into his hands do I reſign my own will, the faculty and powers, the acts and exerciſe of it. What my deareſt Maſter loves ſhall be my delight, and I will deteſt what his ſoul abhors, and he alone ſhall be my guide, who is my beſt friend: my Redeemer came from Heaven to ſhow mankind the way thither, and thither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort ſtay on earth he returned, that he might open that Kingdom to all Believers:
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63922:241"/>I can never wander when he conducts me; I can never hunger when I am treated with the Bread of Life, nor thirſt while the Fountain of Salvation is near me, nor be naked while his Righteouſneſs cloaths me: how ſhall I doubt, who am inſtructed by unerring Wiſdom, or fear, who am protected by Omnipotency? I will therefore live and dye in the ſervice of Jeſus, that I may experiment the ſatisfactions and comfort of a good Conſcience here, and of a Crown of Glory in Heaven.</hi> Amen.</p>
                        <p>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt; be with me, and with all the Servants of God, now and for evermore, <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>
